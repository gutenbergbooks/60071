<p class='c005'><i>The late Lord</i> <span class='sc'>Chesterfield</span> <i>having been universally
allowed to be one of the best bred men of
the age, and most intimately acquainted with the principles
and manners of mankind, the Editor of the following pages
humbly apprehends he could not do the rising generation a
greater service, than by collecting those valuable precepts
which are contained in his celebrated letters to his son, digesting
them under distinct heads, and thereby forming a system
of the most useful instruction.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>To that end, he has diligently selected every observation
and remark that can possibly improve or inform the mind,
within the rules of morality: and where there seemed a deficiency
in any part of the system, from the occasional chasms
in Lord Chesterfield’s correspondence, he has endeavoured to
supply it. Much might have been said on the subject of
indelicacy, but as instructions on that head, to persons possessed
of a liberal education, must have been unnecessary,
they are here purposely omitted. Some may be apt to think,
that many things in this work are too frivolous to be mentioned;
but when it is remembered they are calculated for the
multitude, it is presumed they will be received as respectable
admonitions. In short, it has been the Editor’s study
to make Lord Chesterfield useful to every class of youth; to
lay that instruction before them, which they with difficulty
must have found amidst a heap of other matter; in a word,
to give the very essence of his letters, and at a tenth part
of the</i> price <i>those letters sell for</i>.</p>

    <div>ADDRESSED TO</div>
    <div>EVERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As all young men, on their first outset in life,
are in want of some experienced and friendly
hand to bring them forward, and teach them
a knowledge of the world; I think I cannot do the
rising generation a greater service, than by directing
the young man’s steps, and teaching him how to
make his way among the crowd. I will suppose him
already instructed in the principles of religion, and
necessity of moral virtues; (for without these he must
be most unhappy) of course shall, in a series of chapters,
point out, under distinct heads, the qualifications
necessary to make him well received in the world;
without which, he cannot expect to bear his part in
life, agreeably to his own wishes, or the duty he owes
to society; and as modesty is the basis of a proper reception,
I shall begin with that.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>MODESTY.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Modesty is a polite accomplishment, and
generally an attendant upon merit: It is engaging
to the highest degree, and wins the heart of
all our acquaintance. On the contrary, none are
more disgustful in company than the impudent and
presuming.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>The</span> man who is, on all occasions, commending
and speaking well of himself, we naturally dislike.
On the other hand, he who studies to conceal his own
defects, who does justice to the merit of others, who
talks but little of himself, and that with modesty,
makes a favourable impression on the persons he is
conversing with, captivates their minds, and gains
their esteem.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Modesty</span>, however, widely differs from an awkward
bashfulness, which is as much to be condemned
as the other is to be applauded. To appear simple is
as ill-bred as to be impudent. A young man ought
to be able to come into a room and address the company,
without the least embarrassment. To be out
of countenance when spoken to, and not to have
an answer ready, is ridiculous to the last degree.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>An</span> awkward country fellow, when he comes into
company better than himself, is exceedingly disconcerted.
He knows not what to do with his hands, or
his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket,
and dangles the other by his side; or perhaps twirls
his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with the button.
If spoken to, he is in a much worse situation, he answers
with the utmost difficulty, and nearly stammers;
whereas a gentleman, who is acquainted with life,
enters a room with gracefulness and a modest assurance,
addresses even persons he does not know, in an
easy and natural manner, and without the least embarrassment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>This is the characteristic of good-breeding,
a very necessary knowledge in our intercourse
with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour
of a gentleman, is frequently better received
than a man of sense, with the address and manners of
a clown.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Ignorance</span> and vice are the only things we need
be ashamed of; steer clear of these, and you may go
into any company you will: Not that I would have
a young man throw off all dread of appearing abroad;
as a fear of offending, or being disesteemed, will
make him observe a proper decorum. Some persons
from experiencing the inconveniencies of false modesty,
have run into the other extreme, and acquired the
character of impudent: This is as great a fault as
the other. A well-bred man keeps himself within
the two, and steers the middle way. He is easy and
firm in every company, is modest but not bashful,
steady but not impudent. He copies the manners of
the better people, and conforms to their customs with
ease and attention.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Till</span> we can present ourselves in all companies
with coolness and unconcern, we can never present
ourselves well; nor will a man ever be supposed to
have kept good company, or ever be acceptable in
such company, if he cannot appear there easy and
unembarrassed. A modest assurance, in every part of
life, is the most advantageous qualification we can
possibly acquire.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><span class='sc'>Instead</span> of becoming insolent, a man of sense,
under a consciousness of merit, is more modest. He
behaves himself indeed with firmness, but without the
least presumption. The man who is ignorant of his
own merit, is no less a fool than he who is constantly
displaying it. A man of understanding avails himself
of his abilities, but never boasts of them; whereas
the timid and bashful can never push himself in life,
be his merit as great as it will; he will be always
kept behind by the forward and bustling. A man of
abilities, and acquainted with life, will stand as firm
in defence of his own rights, and pursue his plans
as steadily and unmoved, as the most impudent man
alive; but then he does it with a seeming modesty.
Thus manner is every thing; what is impudence in
one, is proper assurance only in another; for firmness
is commendable, but an overbearing conduct is disgustful.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Forwardness</span> being the very reverse of modesty,
follow rather than lead the company; that is, join in
discourse upon subjects, rather than start one of your
own: If you have parts, you will have opportunities
enough of shewing them on every topic of conversation,
and if you have none, it is better to expose
yourself upon a subject of other people’s than of your
own.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span>, be particularly careful not to speak of yourself,
if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>himself abruptly upon all occasions, and is ever the
hero of his own story. Others will colour their arrogance
with, ‘It may seem strange, indeed, that I
should talk in this manner of myself; it is what I by
no means like, and should never do, if I had not been
cruelly and unjustly accused; but when my character
is attacked, it is a justice I owe to myself, to defend
it.’ This veil is too thin not to be seen through on
the first inspection.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Others</span> again, with more art, will <i>modestly</i> boast
of all the principal virtues, by calling those virtues
weaknesses, and saying, they are so unfortunate as to
fall into weaknesses. ‘I cannot see persons suffer,’
says one of this cast, ‘without relieving them;
though my circumstances are very unable to afford
it.’ ‘I cannot avoid speaking truth, though it is
often very imprudent,’ and so on.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> angling for praise is so prevailing a principle,
that it frequently stoops to the lowest objects. Men
will often boast of doing that, which, if true, would
be rather a disgrace to them than otherwise. One
man affirms that he rode twenty miles within the
hour; ’tis probably a lie; but suppose he did, what
then? He had a good horse under him, and is a
good jockey. Another swears he has often at a sitting,
drank five or six bottles to his own share. Out
of respect to him, I will believe <i>him</i> a liar, for I
would not wish to think him a beast.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><span class='sc'>These</span> and many more are the follies of idle people,
which, while they think they procure them esteem,
in reality make them despised.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To</span> avoid this contempt, therefore, never speak of
yourself at all, unless necessity obliges you; and even
then, take care to do it in such a manner, that it may
not be construed in to fishing for applause. Whatever
perfections you may have, be assured, people will find
them out; but whether they do or not, nobody will
take them upon your own word. The less you say of
yourself, the more the world will give you credit for;
and the more you say, the less they will believe you.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>LYING.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the vices, there is no one more criminal,
more mean, and more ridiculous, than lying.
The end we design by it is very seldom accomplished,
for lies are always found out, at one time or other;
and yet there are persons who give way to this vice,
who are otherwise of good principles, and have not
been ill educated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Lies</span> generally proceed from vanity, cowardice,
and a revengeful disposition, and sometimes from a
mistaken notion of self-defence.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>He</span> who tells a malicious lie, with a view of injuring
the person he speaks of, may gratify his wish for
a while, but will, in the end, find it recoil upon himself;
for, as soon as he is detected (and detected he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>most certainly will be) he is despised for the infamous
attempt, and whatever he may say hereafter of that
person, will be considered as false, whether it be so or
not.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> a man lies, shuffles, or equivocates, for, in fact,
they are all alike, by way of excuse for any thing he
has said or done, he aggravates the offence rather than
lessens it; for the person to whom the lie is told has a
right to know the truth, or there would have been no
occasion to have framed a falsehood. This person, of
course, will think himself ill treated for being a second
time affronted; for what can be a greater affront
than an attempt to impose upon any man’s understanding?
Besides, lying, in excuse for a fault, betrays
fear, than which nothing is more dastardly, and
unbecoming the character of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is nothing more manly, or more noble, if
we have done wrong, than frankly to own it. It is
the only way of meeting forgiveness. Indeed, confessing
a fault and asking pardon, with great minds, is
considered as a sufficient atonement. ‘I have been
betrayed into an error,’ or ‘I have injured you,
Sir, and am heartily ashamed of it, and sorry for it,’
has frequently disarmed the person injured, and where
he would have been our enemy, has made him our
friend.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are persons also, whose <i>vanity</i> leads them
to tell a thousand lies. They persuade themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>that if it be no way injurious to others, it is harmless
and innocent, and they shelter their falsehoods under
the softer name of <i>untruths</i>. These persons are foolish
enough to imagine, that if they can recite any thing
wonderful, they draw the attention of the company,
and if they themselves are the objects of that wonder,
they are looked up to as persons extraordinary. This
has made many men to see things that never were
in being, hear things that never were said, atchieve
feats that never were attempted, dealing always in the
marvellous. Such may be assured, however unwilling
the persons they are conversing with may be to laugh
in their faces, that they hold them secretly in the
highest contempt; for he who will tell a lie thus idly,
will not scruple to tell a greater, where his interest is
concerned. Rather than any person should doubt of
my veracity for one minute, I would deprive myself
of telling abroad either what I had really seen or
heard, if such things did not carry with them the
face of probability.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Others</span> again will boast of the great respect they
meet with in certain companies; of the honors that
are continually heaped on them there; of the great
price they give for every thing they purchase; and
this to be thought of consequence; but, unless such
people have the best and most accurate memory, they
will, perhaps, very soon after, contradict their former
assertions, and subject themselves to contempt and
derision.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><span class='sc'>Remember</span> then as long as you live, that nothing
but strict truth can carry you through life with honor
and credit. Liars are not only disagreeable but dangerous
companions, and, when known, will ever be
shunned by men of understanding. Besides, as the
greatest liars are generally the greatest fools, a man
who addicts himself to this detestable vice, will not
only be looked upon as vulgar, but will never be
considered as a man of sense.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>GOOD-BREEDING.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Void</span> of good-breeding, every other qualification
will be imperfect, unadorned, and to a certain
degree unavailing.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Good-breeding</span> being the result of good sense
and good nature, is it not wonderful that people possessed
of the one, should be deficient in the other?
The modes of it, varying according to persons, places,
and circumstances, cannot indeed be acquired otherwise
than by time and observation, but the substance
is every where and always the same.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>What</span> good morals are to society in general, good
manners are to particular ones; their band and security.
Of all actions, next to that of performing a
good one, the consciousness of rendering a civility is
the most grateful.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>We</span> seldom see a person, let him be ever so ill-bred,
want in respect to those whom he acknowledges to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>his superiors; the manner of shewing this respect,
then, is all I contend for. The well-bred man expresses
it naturally and easily, while he who is unused
to good company expresses it awkwardly. Study,
then, to shew that respect which every one wishes to
shew, in an easy and grateful way; but this must be
learnt by observation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> company with your equals, or in mixed companies,
a greater latitude may be taken in your behaviour;
yet, it should never exceed the bounds of decency;
for, though no one in this case, can claim any
distinguished marks of respect, every one is entitled to
civility and good manners. A man need not, for example,
fear to put his hands in his pockets, take snuff,
sit, stand, or occasionally walk about the room; but it
would be highly unbecoming to whistle, wear his hat,
loosen his garters, or throw himself across the chairs.
Such liberties are offensive to our equals, and insulting
to our inferiors. Easiness of carriage by no means
implies inattention and carelessness. No one is at liberty
to act, in all respects, as he pleases; but is
bound by the laws of good manners to behave with
decorum.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Let</span> a man talk to you ever so stupidly or frivolously,
not to pay some attention to what he says, is
savageness to the greatest degree. Nay, if he even
forces his conversation to you, it is worse than rudeness
not to listen to him; for your inattention in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>case, tells him, in express terms, that you think him
a blockhead and not worth the hearing. Now, if such
behaviour is rude to men, it is much more so to women,
who, be their rank what it will, have, on account
of their sex, a claim to officious attention from
the men. Their little wants and whims, their likes
and dislikes, and even their impertinences, are particularly
attended to and flattered, and their very
thoughts and wishes guessed at and instantly gratified,
by every well-bred man.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> promiscuous companies, you should vary your
address, agreeably to the different ages of the persons
you speak to. It would be rude and absurd to talk
of your amours or your pleasures to men of certain
dignity and gravity, to clergymen, or men in years;
but still you should be as easy with them as with others,
your manner only should be varied; you should,
if possible, double your respect and attention to them;
and were you to insinuate occasionally, that from their
observation and experience you wish to profit, you
would insensibly win their esteem; for flattery, if not
fulsome and gross, is agreeable to all.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> invited to dinner or supper, you must never
usurp to yourself the best places, the best dishes, &amp;c.
but always decline them, and offer them to others, except,
indeed, you are offered any thing by a superior,
when it would be a rudeness, if you liked it, not to
accept it immediately, without the least apology.—Thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>for example, was a superior, the master of the
table, to offer you a thing of which there was but one,
to pass it to the person next you, would be indirectly
charging him that offered it to you, with a want of
good manners and proper respect to his company; or,
if you were the only stranger present, it would be a
rudeness if you make a feint of refusing it with the
customary apology, ‘I cannot think of taking it from
you, sir;’ or, ‘I am sorry to deprive you of it;’ as
it is supposed he is conscious of his own rank, and if
he chose not to give it, would not have offered it;
your apology therefore, in this case, is putting him
upon an equality with yourself. In like manner, it
is rudeness to draw back when requested by a superior
to pass a door first, or to step into a carriage before
him. In short, it would be endless to particularise all
the instances in which a well-bred man shews his politeness
in good company, such as not yawning, singing,
whistling, warming his breech at the fire, lounging,
putting his legs upon the chairs, and the like,
familiarities every man’s good sense must condemn,
and good-breeding abhor.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span>, good-breeding consists in more than merely
not being ill-bred. To return a bow, speak when you
are spoken to, and say nothing rude, are such negative
acts of good-breeding, that they are little more
than not being a brute. Would it not be a very poor
commendation of any man’s cleanliness, to say that he
was not offensive? If we wish for the good will and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>esteem of our acquaintance, our good-breeding must
be active, cheerful, officious and seducing.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>For</span> example, should you invite any one to dine or
sup with you, recollect whether ever you had observed
them to prefer one thing to another, and endeavour to
procure that thing; when at table, say, ‘At such a
time, I think you seemed to give this dish a preference,
I therefore ordered it.’ ‘This is the wine I
observed you like best, I have therefore been at some
pains to procure it.’ Trifling as these things may
appear, they prove an attention to the person they are
said to; and as attention in trifles is the test of respect,
the compliment will not be lost.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I need</span> only refer you to your own breast. How
have these little attentions, when shewn you by others,
flattered that self-love which no man is free from?
They incline and attach us to that person, and prejudice
us afterwards, to all that he says or does. The
declaration of the women in a great degree stamps a
man’s reputation of being either ill or well-bred; you
must then, in a manner, overwhelm them with these
attentions; they are used to them, and naturally expect
them, and to do them justice, they are seldom
lost upon them. You must be sedulous to wait upon
them, pick up with alacrity any thing they drop, and
be very officious in procuring their carriages or their
chairs in public places; be blind to what you should
not see, and deaf to what you should not hear. Opportunities
of shewing these attentions are continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>presenting themselves; but in case they should not,
you must study to create them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> ever you would be esteemed by the women, your
conversation to them should be always respectful, lively,
and addressed to their vanity. Every thing you
say or do, should tend to shew a regard to their beauty
or good sense: Even men are not without their vanities
of one kind or another, and flattering that vanity
by words and looks of approbation, is one of the
principal characters of good-breeding.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Address</span> and manners, with weak persons, who
are actually three-fourths of the world, are every
thing; and even people of the best understanding are
taken in with them. Where the heart is not won,
and the eye pleased, the mind will be seldom on our
side.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> short, learning and erudition, without good-breeding,
are tiresome and pedantic; and an ill-bred
man is as unfit for good company, as he will be unwelcome
in it. Nay, he is full as unfit for business
as for company. Make, then, good-breeding the
great object of your thoughts and actions. Be particularly
observant of, and endeavour to imitate, the
behaviour and manners of such as are distinguished by
their politeness; and be persuaded, that good-breeding
is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to
all Christian virtues; it adorns merit, and often covers
the want of it.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>GENTEEL CARRIAGE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Next</span> to good-breeding is a genteel manner
and carriage, wholly free from those ill habits
and awkward actions, which many very worthy persons
are addicted to.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A genteel</span> manner of behaviour, how trifling so-ever
it may seem, is of the utmost consequence in private
life. Men of very inferior parts have been esteemed,
merely for their genteel carriage and good-breeding,
while sensible men have given disgust for
want of it. There is something or other that prepossesses
us at first sight, in favour of a well-bred man,
and makes us wish to like him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> an awkward fellow first comes into a room,
he attempts to bow, and his sword, if he wears one,
goes between his legs, and nearly throws him down.
Confused and ashamed, he stumbles to the upper end
of the room, and seats himself in the very chair he
should not. He there begins playing with his hat,
which he presently drops; and recovering his hat, he
lets fall his cane; and in picking up his cane, down
goes his hat again; thus ’tis a considerable time before
he is adjusted. When his tea or coffee is handed to
him, he spreads his handkerchief upon his knees, scalds
his mouth, drops either the cup or the saucer, and
spills the tea or coffee in his lap. At dinner he is
more uncommonly awkward; there he tucks his napkin
through a button-hole, which tickles his chin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and occasions him to make a variety of wry faces; he
seats himself upon the edge of the chair, at so great a
distance from the table, that he frequently drops his
meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his
knife, fork and spoon differently from other people;
eats with his knife, to the manifest danger of his
mouth; picks his teeth with his fork, rakes his mouth
with his finger, and puts his spoon which has been in
his throat a dozen times, into the dish again. If he is
to carve, he cannot hit the joint, but in labouring to
cut through the bone, splashes the sauce over every
body’s cloaths. He generally daubs himself all over,
his elbows are in the next person’s plate, and he is
up to the knuckles in soup and grease. If he drinks,
it is with his mouth full, interrupting the whole company
with ‘To your good health, sir,’ and ‘My
service to you;’ perhaps coughs in his glass, and be-sprinkles
the whole table. Further, he has perhaps a
number of disagreeable tricks, he snuffs up his nose,
picks it with his fingers, blows it, and looks in his
handkerchief, crams his hands first into his bosom,
and next into his breeches. In short, he neither dresses
nor acts like any other person, but is particularly
awkward in every thing he does. All this, I own,
has nothing in it criminal; but it is such an offence
to good manners and good-breeding, that it is universally
despised; it makes a man ridiculous in every
company, and, of course, ought carefully to be avoided
by every one who would wish to please.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>From</span> this picture of the ill-bred man, you will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>easily discover that of the well-bred; for you may readily
judge what you ought to do, when you are told
what you ought not to do; a little attention to the
manners of those who have seen the world, will make
a proper behaviour habitual and familiar to you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Actions</span>, that would otherwise be pleasing, frequently
become ridiculous by the manner of doing
them. If a lady drop her fan in company, the worst-bred
man would immediately pick it up, and give it
to her; the best bred man can do no more; but then
he does it in a graceful manner, that is sure to please;
whereas the other would do it so awkwardly as to be
laughed at.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> may also know a well-bred person by his manner
of sitting. Ashamed and confused, the awkward
man sits in his chair stiff and bolt upright, whereas
the man of fashion, is easy in every position; instead
of lolling or lounging as he sits, he leans with elegance,
and by varying his attitudes, shews that he has
been used to good company. Let it be one part of
your study then, to learn to sit genteely in different
companies, to loll gracefully, where you are authorized
to take that liberty, and sit up respectfully, where
that freedom is not allowable.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> short, you cannot conceive how advantageous a
graceful carriage and a pleasing address are, upon all
occasions; they ensnare the affections, seal a prepossession
in our favour, and play about the heart till
they engage it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><span class='sc'>Now</span> to acquire a graceful air, you must attend to
your dancing; no one can either sit, stand or walk
well, unless he dances well. And, in learning to
dance, be particularly attentive to the motion of your
arms, for a stiffness in the wrist will make any man
look awkward. If a man walks well, presents himself
well in company, wears his hat well, moves his
head properly, and his arms gracefully, it is almost
all that is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is also an awkwardness in speech, that naturally
falls under this head, and ought to and may
be guarded against; such as forgetting names, and
mistaking one name for another; to speak of Mr.
What-d’ye-call-him, or You-know-who, Mrs. Thingum,
What’s-her-name, or How-d’ye-call-her, is exceedingly
awkward and vulgar. It is the same to address
people by improper titles, as <i>sir</i> for <i>my lord</i>; to
begin a story without being able to finish it, and break
off in the middle, with,  ‘I have forgot the rest.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Our</span> voice and manner of speaking too, should
likewise be attended to. Some will mumble over
their words, so as not to be intelligible, and others
will speak so fast as not to be understood, and, in doing
this, will spatter and spit in your face;  some will
bawl as if they were speaking to the deaf; others will
speak so low as scarcely to be heard;  and many will
put their face so close to yours, as to offend you with
their breath. All these habits are horrid and disgustful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>but may easily be got the better of, with care.
They are the vulgar characteristics of a low-bred man,
or are proofs that very little pains have been bestowed
in his education. In short, an attention to these little
matters is of greater importance than you are aware
of; many sensible men having lost ground for want
of these little graces, and many, possessed of these
perfections alone, having made their way through life,
who otherwise would not have been noticed.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>CLEANLINESS of PERSON.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>But</span>, as no one can please in company, however
graceful in his air, unless he be clean and neat
in his person, this qualification comes next to be considered.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Negligence</span> of one’s person not only implies an
unsufferable indolence, but an indifference whether
we please or not. It betrays an insolence and affectation,
arising from a presumption, that we are sure of
pleasing, without having recourse to those means
which many are obliged to use.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>He</span> who is not thoroughly clean in his person, will
be offensive to all he converses with. A particular
regard to the cleanliness of your mouth, teeth, hands
and nails, is but common decency. A foul mouth
and unclean hands, are certain marks of vulgarity;
the first is the cause of an offensive breath, which nobody
can bear, and the last is declarative of dirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>work; one may always know a gentleman by the state
of his hands and nails. The flesh at the roots should
be kept back, so as to shew the semicircles at the bottom
of the nails; the edges of the nails should never
be cut down below the ends of the fingers, nor should
they be suffered to grow longer than the fingers.
When the nails are cut down to the quick, it is a
shrewd sign that the man is a mechanic, to whom long
nails would be troublesome, or that he gets his bread
by fiddling; and if they are longer than his fingers’
ends, and encircled with a black rim, it foretells he
has been laboriously and meanly employed, and too
fatigued to clean himself; a good apology for want
of cleanliness in a mechanic, but the greatest disgrace
that can attend a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>These</span> things may appear too insignificant to be
mentioned; but when it is considered that a thousand
little nameless things, which every one feels, but no
one can describe, conspire to form that <i>whole</i> of pleasing,
I hope you will not call them trifling. Besides,
a clean shirt and a clean person are as necessary to
health, as not to offend other people. It is a maxim
with me, which I have lived to see verified, that he
who is negligent at twenty years of age, will be a sloven
at forty, and intolerable at fifty.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>DRESS.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Neatness</span> of person, I observed, was as
necessary as cleanliness; of course, some attention
must be paid to your dress.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><span class='sc'>Such</span> is the absurdity of the times, that to pass
well with the world, we must adopt some of its customs,
be they ridiculous or not.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> the first place, to neglect one’s dress is to affront
all the female part of our acquaintance. The women
in particular pay an attention to their dress; to neglect
therefore yours will displease them, as it would
be tacitly taxing them with vanity, and declaring that
you thought them not worth that respect which every
body else does. And, as I have mentioned before, it
being the women who stamp a young man’s credit in
the fashionable world, if you do not make yourself
agreeable to them, you will assuredly lose ground
among the men.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dress</span>, as trifling as it may appear to a man of
understanding, prepossesses on the first appearance,
which is frequently decisive. And indeed we form
some opinion of a man’s sense and character from his
dress. Any exceeding of the fashion, or any affectation
whatever in dress, argues a weakness in understanding,
and nine times in ten, it will be found so.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are few young fellows but what display some
character or other in this shape. Some would be
thought fearless and brave; these wear a black cravat,
a short coat and waistcoat, an uncommon long sword
hanging to their knees, a large hat fiercely cocked,
and are <i>flash</i> all over. Others affect to be country
squires; these will go about in buckskin breeches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>brown frocks, and great oaken cudgels in their hands,
slouched hats, with their hair undressed and tucked
up under them to an enormous size, and imitate
grooms and country boobies so well externally, that
there is not the least doubt of their resembling them
as well internally. Others, again, paint and powder
themselves so much, and dress so finically, as leads us
to suppose they are only women in boy’s cloaths.
Now a sensible man carefully avoids all this, or any
other affectation. He dresses as fashionably and as
well as persons of the best families and best sense; if
he exceeds them, he is a coxcomb; if he dresses worse,
he is unpardonable.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dress</span> yourself fine, then, if possible, or plain, agreeably
to the company you are in; that is, conform
to the dress of others, and avoid the appearance of
being tumbled. Imitate those reasonable people of
your own age, whose dress is neither remarked as too
neglected or too much studied. Take care to have
your clothes well made, in the fashion, and to fit you,
or you will, after all, appear awkward. When once
dressed, think no more of it; shew no fear of discomposing
your dress, but let all your motions be as easy
and unembarrassed, as if you were at home in your
dishabille.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>ELEGANCE of EXPRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Having</span> mentioned elegance of person, I
will proceed to elegance of expression.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><span class='sc'>It</span> is not one or two qualifications alone complete
the gentleman; it must be a union of many; and
graceful speaking is as essential as gracefulness of person.
Every man cannot be a harmonious speaker;
a roughness or coarseness of voice may prevent it; but
if there are no natural imperfections, if a man does
not stammer or lisp, or has not lost his teeth, he may
speak gracefully; nor will all these defects, if he has
a mind to it, prevent him from speaking correctly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Nobody</span> can attend with pleasure to a bad speaker.
One who tells his story ill, be it ever so important,
will tire even the most patient. If you have been
present at the performance of a good tragedy, you
have doubtless been sensible of the good effects of a
speech well delivered; how much it has interested and
affected you; and on the contrary, how much an ill
spoken one has disgusted you. ’Tis the same in common
conversation; he who speaks deliberately, distinctly
and correctly: He who makes use of the best
words to express himself, and varies his voice according
to the nature of the subject, will always please,
while the thick or hasty speaker, he who mumbles
out a set of ill-chosen words, utters them ingrammatically,
or with a dull monotony, will tire and disgust.
Be assured then, the air, the gesture, the looks
of a speaker, a proper accent, a just emphasis, and
tuneful cadence, are full as necessary to please and be
attended to, as the subject matter itself.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><span class='sc'>People</span> may talk what they will of solid reasoning
and sound sense; without the graces and ornaments
of language, they will neither please nor persuade.
In common discourse, even trifles elegantly expressed
will be better received than the best of arguments
homespun and unadorned.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A good</span> way to acquire a graceful utterance is to
read aloud to some friend every day, and beg of him
to set you right, in case you read too fast, do not observe
the proper stops, lay a wrong emphasis, or utter
your words indistinctly. You may even read aloud to
yourself, where such a friend is not at hand, and you
will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care
to open your teeth when you read or speak, and articulate
every word distinctly; which last cannot be
done, but by sounding the final letter. But above
all, endeavour to vary your voice, according to the
matter, and avoid a monotony. By a daily attention
to this, it will, in a little time, become easy and habitual
to you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Pay</span> an attention also to your looks and your gestures,
when talking even on the most trifling subjects;
things appear very different according as they are expressed,
looked and delivered.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Now</span>, if it is necessary to attend so particularly to
our <i>manner</i> of speaking, it is much more so, with respect
to the <i>matter</i>. Fine turns of expression, a genteel
and correct style, are ornaments as requisite to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>common sense, as polite behaviour and an elegant
address are to common good manners; they are great
assistants in the point of pleasing. A gentleman, ’tis
true, may be known in the meanest garb, but it admits
not of a doubt, that he would be better received
into good company, genteelly and fashionably dressed,
than if he appeared in dirt and tatters.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Be</span> careful then of your style upon all occasions;
whether you write or speak, study for the best words
and best expressions, even in common conversation, or
the most familiar letters. This will prevent your
speaking in a hurry, than which nothing is more vulgar;
though you may be a little embarrassed at first,
time and use will render it easy. It is no such difficult
thing to express ourselves well on subjects we
are thoroughly acquainted with, if we think before
we speak; and no one should presume to do otherwise.
When you have said a thing, if you did not reflect
before, be sure to do it afterwards; consider with yourself,
whether you could not have expressed yourself
better; and if you are in doubt of the propriety or
elegancy of any word, search for it in some dictionary,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
or some good author, while you remember it:
Never be sparing of your trouble while you would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>wish to improve, and my word for it, a very little
time will make this matter habitual.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> order to speak grammatically, and to express
yourself pleasingly, I would recommend it to you to
translate often any language you are acquainted with
into English, and to correct such translation till the
words, their order, and the periods, are agreeable to
your own ear.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Vulgarism</span> in language is another distinguishing
mark of bad company and education. Expressions
may be correct in themselves, and yet be vulgar, owing
to their not being fashionable; for language and
manners are both established by the usage of people
of fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> conversation of a low-bred man is filled up
with proverbs and hackneyed sayings. Instead of observing
that tastes are different, and that most men
have one peculiar to themselves, he will give you,
‘What is one man’s meat is another man’s poison;’
or, ‘Every one to their liking, as the old woman said,
when she killed her cow.’ He has ever some favourite
word, which he lugs in upon all occasions,
right or wrong; such as <i>vastly</i> angry, <i>vastly</i> kind;
<i>devilish</i> ugly, <i>devilish</i> handsome; <i>immensely</i> great, <i>immensely</i>
little. Even his pronunciation carries the
mark of vulgarity along with it; he calls the earth,
<i>yearth</i>; finan’ces, <i>fin’ances</i>; he goes <i>to words</i>, and not
towards such a place. He affects to use hard words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to give him the appearance of a man of learning, but
frequently mistakes their meaning, and seldom, if
ever, pronounces them properly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>All</span> this must be avoided, if you would not be
supposed to have kept company with footmen and
housemaids. Never have recourse to proverbial or
vulgar sayings; use neither favourite nor hard words,
but seek for the most elegant; be careful in the management
of them, and depend on it your labour will
not be lost; for nothing is more engaging than a fashionable
and polite address.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>ADDRESS, PHRASEOLOGY, and SMALL-TALK.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>In</span> all good company, we meet with a certain
manner, phraseology, and general conversation,
that distinguish the man of fashion. These can only
be acquired by frequenting good company, and being
particularly attentive to all that passes there.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> invited to dine or sup at the house of any
well-bred man, observe how he does the honors of his
table, and mark his manner of treating his company.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Attend</span> to the compliments of congratulation or
condolence that he pays; and take notice of his address
to his superiors, his equals and his inferiors;
nay, his very looks and tone of voice, are worth your
attention, for we cannot please without a union of
them all.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>There</span> is a certain distinguishing diction that
marks the man of fashion, a certain language of conversation
that every gentleman should be master of.
Saying to a man just married, ‘I wish you joy,’ or to
one who has lost his wife, ‘I am sorry for your loss,’
and both perhaps with an unmeaning countenance,
may be civil, but it is nevertheless vulgar. A man
of fashion will express the same thing more elegantly,
and with a look of sincerity, that shall attract the esteem
of the person he speaks to. He will advance to
the one, with warmth and cheerfulness, and perhaps
squeezing him by the hand, will say, ‘Believe me,
my dear Sir, I have scarce words to express the joy
I feel, upon your happy alliance with such or such
a family,’ &amp;c. To the other in affliction, he will advance
slower, and with a peculiar composure of voice
and countenance, begin his compliments of condolence
with, ‘I hope, Sir, you will do me the justice
to be persuaded, that I am not insensible of your
unhappiness, that I take part in your distress, and
shall ever be affected where <i>you</i> are so.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Your</span> first address to, and indeed all your conversation
with, your superiors, should be open, cheerful
and respectful; with your equals warm and animated;
with your inferiors, hearty, free and unreserved.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a fashionable kind of small-talk, which
however trifling it may be thought, has its use in
mixed companies: Of course you should endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to acquire it. By small-talk, I mean a good deal to say
on unimportant matters; for example, foods, the flavour
and growth of wines, and the chit-chat of the
day. Such conversation will serve to keep off serious
subjects, that might sometimes create disputes. This
chit-chat is chiefly to be learned by frequenting the
company of the ladies.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>OBSERVATION.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>As</span> the art of pleasing is to be learnt only by
frequenting the best companies, we must endeavor
to pick it up in such companies by observation;
for, it is not sense and knowledge alone that will acquire
esteem; these certainly are the first and necessary
foundations for pleasing, but they will by no means
do, unless attended with manners and attentions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> have been people who have frequented the
first companies all their life time, and yet have never
got rid of their natural stiffness and awkwardness;
but have continued as vulgar as if they were never
out of a servant’s hall: This has been owing to carelessness,
and a want of attention to the manners and
behaviour of others.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are a great many people likewise who busy
themselves the whole day, and who in fact do nothing.
They have possibly taken up a book for two or three
hours, but from a certain inattention that grows upon
them the more it is indulged, know no more of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>contents than if they had not looked into it; nay, it
is impossible for any one to retain what he reads, unless
he reflects and reasons upon it as he goes on.
When they have thus lounged away an hour or two,
they will saunter into company, without attending to
any thing that passes there; but, if they think at all,
are thinking of some trifling matter that ought not to
occupy their attention; thence perhaps they go to the
play, where they stare at the company and the lights,
without attending to the piece, the very thing they
went to see. In this manner they wear away their
hours, that might otherwise be employed to their improvement
and advantage. This silly suspension of
thought they would pass for <i>absence of mind</i>—ridiculous!—Wherever
you are, let me recommend it to
you to pay an attention to all that passes; observe the
characters of the persons you are with, and the subjects
of their conversation; listen to every thing that is said,
see every thing that is done, and (according to the
vulgar saying) have your eyes and your ears about
you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A continual</span> inattention to matters that occur,
is the characteristic of a weak mind; the man who
gives way to it, is little else than a trifler, a blank in
society, which every sensible person overlooks; surely
what is worth doing, is worth doing well, and nothing
can be well done, if not properly attended to.
When I hear a man say, on being asked about any
thing that was said or done in his presence, ‘that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>truly he did not mind it.’ I am ready to knock the
fool down. <i>Why</i> did not he mind it?—What else
had he to do?—A man of sense and fashion never
makes use of this paltry plea, he never complains of a
treacherous memory, but attends to and remembers
every thing that is either said or done.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Whenever</span>, then, you go into good company,
that is the company of people of fashion, observe carefully
their behaviour, their address and their manner;
imitate them as far as in your power. Your attention,
if possible, should be so ready as to observe every person
in the room at once, their motions, their looks,
and their turns of expression, and that without staring,
or seeming to be an observer. This kind of observation
may be acquired by care and practice, and will
be found of the utmost advantage to you, in the
course of life.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>ABSENCE of MIND.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Having</span> mentioned absence of mind, let me
be more particular concerning it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>What</span> the world calls an absent man, is generally
either a very affected one, or a very weak one; but
whether weak or affected, he is, in company, a very
disagreeable man. Lost in thought, or possibly in no
thought at all, he is a stranger to every one present,
and to every thing that passes; he knows not his best
friends, is deficient in every act of good manners, unobservant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of the actions of the company, and insensible
to his own. His answers are quite the reverse of what
they ought to be; talk to him of one thing, he replies,
as of another. He forgets what he said last,
leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and
his sword in a third; nay, if it was not for his buckles,
he would even leave his shoes behind him. Neither
his arms nor his legs seem to be a part of his body,
and his head is never in a right position. He
joins not in the general conversation, except it be by
fits and starts, as if awaking from a dream: I attribute
this either to weakness or affectation. His shallow
mind is possibly not able to attend to more than
one thing at a time; or he would be supposed wrap’d
up in the investigation of some very important matter.
Such men as Sir Isaac Newton or Mr. Locke, might
occasionally have some excuse for absence of mind!
It might proceed from that intenseness of thought
which was necessary at all times for the scientific subjects
they were studying; but, for a young man, and a
man of the world, who has no such plea to make, absence
of mind is rudeness to the company, and deserves
the severest censure.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>However</span> insignificant a company may be; however
trifling their conversation; while you are with
them, do not shew them, by an inattention, that you
think them trifling; that can never be the way to
please, but rather fall in with their weakness than otherwise;
for to mortify, or shew the least contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to those we are in company with, is the greatest rudeness
we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I never</span> yet found a man inattentive to the person
he feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces
me, that absence of mind is to be got the better of, if
we think proper to make the trial; and believe me,
it is always worth the attempt.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Absence</span> of mind is a tacit declaration, that those
we are in company with, are not worth attending to;
and what can be a greater affront?——Besides, can
an absent man improve by what is said or done in his
presence? No; he may frequent the best companies
for years together, and all to no purpose. In short, a
man is neither fit for business nor conversation, unless
he can attend to the object before him, be that object
what it will.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>KNOWLEDGE of the WORLD.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>A knowledge</span> of the world, by our
own experience and observation, is so necessary,
that, without it, we shall act very absurdly, and frequently
give offence, when we do not mean it. All
the learning and parts in the world, will not secure us
from it. Without an acquaintance with life, a man
may say very good things, but time them so ill, and
address them so improperly, that he had much better
be silent. Full of himself, and his own business, and
inattentive to the circumstances and situations of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>he converses with, he vents it without the least discretion,
says things that he ought not to say, confuses
some, shocks others, and puts the whole company in
pain, lest what he utters next should prove worse than
the last. The best direction I can give you in this
matter, is rather to fall in with the conversation of others,
than start a subject of your own; rather strive
to put them more in conceit with themselves, than to
draw their attention to you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A novice</span> in life, he who knows little of mankind,
but what he collects from books, lays it down as a
maxim, that most men love flattery; in order therefore
to please, he will flatter. But how? Without
regard either to circumstances or occasion. Instead
of those delicate touches, those soft tints, that serve
to heighten the piece, he lays on his colours with a
heavy hand, and daubs, where he means to adorn; in
other words, he will flatter so unseasonably, and at
the same time so grossly, that while he wishes to please,
he puts out of countenance, and is sure to offend.
On the contrary, a man of the world, one who has
made life his study, knows the power of flattery as
well as he; but, then, he knows how to apply it; he
watches the opportunity, and does it indirectly, by
inference, comparison and hint.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Man</span> is made up of such a variety of matter, that
to search him thoroughly, requires time and attention;
for, though we are all made of the same materials,
and have all the same passions, yet, from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>difference in their proportion and combination, we
vary in our dispositions; what is agreeable to one is
disagreeable to another, and what one shall approve,
another shall condemn. Reason is given us to controul
these passions, but seldom does it. Application
therefore to the reason of any man, will frequently
prove ineffectual, unless we endeavour at the same time
to gain his heart.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Wherever</span> then you are, search into the characters
of men; find out if possible, their foible, their governing
passion, or their particular merit; take them on
their weak side, and you will generally succeed; their
prevailing vanity you may readily discover, by observing
their favourite topic of conversation; for every one
talks most, of what he would be thought most to excel
in.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> time should also be judiciously made choice of.
Every man has his particular times, when he may be
applied to with success, the <i>mollia tempora fandi</i>; but
these times are not all day long, they must be found
out, watched, and taken advantage of. You could
not hope for success in applying to a man about one
business, when he was taken up with another, or
when his mind was affected with excess of grief, anger,
or the like.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> cannot judge of other men’s minds better
than by studying your own; for though one man
has one foible, and another has another, yet men, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>general, are very much alike. Whatever pleases or
offends you, will, in similar circumstances, please or
offend others; if you find yourself hurt, when another
makes you feel his superiority, you will certainly upon
the common rule of right, <i>Do as you would be done
by</i>, take care not to let another feel <i>your</i> superiority,
if you have it; especially if you wish to gain his interest
or esteem. If disagreeable insinuations, open
contradictions, or oblique sneers, vex and anger you,
would you use them where you wished to please?
Certainly not. Observe then, with care, the operations
of your own mind, and you may, in a great
measure, read all mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I will</span> allow that one bred up in a cloister or college,
may reason well on the structure of the human
mind; he may investigate the nature of man, and give
a tolerable account of his head, his heart, his passions,
and his sentiments: but at the same time he may
know nothing of him; he has not lived with him,
and of course knows but little how those sentiments or
those passions will work.—He must be ignorant of the
various prejudices, propensities and antipathies, that
always bias him, and frequently determine him. His
knowledge is acquired only from theory, which differs
widely from practice; and if he forms his judgment
from that alone, he must be often deceived; whereas
a man of the world, one who collects his knowledge
from his own experience and observation, is seldom
wrong; he is well acquainted with the operations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the human mind; prys into the heart of man; reads
his words, before they are uttered; sees his actions,
before they are performed; knows what will please
and what will displease, and foresees the event of most
things.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Labour</span> then to acquire this intuitive knowledge;
attend carefully to the address, the arts and manners
of those acquainted with life, and endeavour to imitate
them. Observe the means they take, to gain the
favour, and conciliate the affections of those they associate
with; pursue those means, and you will soon
gain the esteem of all that know you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>How</span> often have we seen men governed by persons
very much their inferiors in point of understanding,
and even without their knowing it? A proof that
some men have more worldly dexterity than others;
they find out the weak and unguarded part, make
their attack there, and the man surrenders.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Now</span> from a knowledge of mankind we shall learn
the advantage of two things, the command of our
temper and countenances; a trifling, disagreeable incident
shall perhaps anger one unacquainted with life,
or confound him with shame; shall make him rave
like a madman, or look like a fool; but a man of the
world will never understand what he cannot or ought
not to resent. If he should chance to make a slip
himself, he will stifle his confusion, and turn it off
with a jest, recovering it with coolness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><span class='sc'>Many</span> people have sense enough to keep their own
secrets; but from being unused to a variety of company,
have unfortunately such a tell-tale countenance,
as involuntarily declares what they would wish to conceal.
This is a great unhappiness, and should, as
soon as possible, be got the better of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>That</span> coolness of mind, and evenness of countenance,
which prevent a discovery of our sentiments,
by our words, our actions, or our looks, are too necessary
to pass unnoticed. A man who cannot hear displeasing
things, without visible marks of anger or uneasiness;
or pleasing ones, without a sudden burst of
joy, a cheerful eye, or an expanded face, is at the
mercy of every knave; for either they will designedly
please or provoke you themselves, to catch your unguarded
looks; or they will seize the opportunity
thus to read your very heart, when another shall do it.
You may possibly tell me, that this coolness must be
natural, for if not, you can never acquire it. I will
admit the force of constitution, but people are very
apt to blame <i>that</i>, for many things they might readily
avoid. Care, with a little reflection, will soon give
you this mastery of your temper and countenance.
If you find yourself subject to sudden starts of passion,
determine with yourself not to utter a single word till
your reason has recovered itself; and resolve to keep
your countenance as unmoved as possible. As a man,
who at a card table can preserve a serenity in his looks,
under good or bad luck, has considerably the advantage
of one who appears elated with success, or cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>down with ill fortune, from our being able to read his
cards in his face, so the man of the world, having to
deal with one of these babbling countenances, will
take care to profit by the circumstance, let the consequence,
to him with whom he deals, be as injurious
as it may.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> the course of life, we shall find it necessary very
often to put on a pleasing countenance, when we are
exceedingly displeased; we must frequently seem
friendly, when we are quite otherwise. I am sensible
it is difficult to accost a man with smiles whom we
know to be our enemy; but what is to be done? On
receiving an affront, if you cannot be justified in
knocking the offender down, you must not notice the
offence; for, in the eye of the world, taking an affront
calmly is considered as cowardice.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> fools should attempt at any time to be witty upon
you, the best way is not to know their witticisms
are leveled at you, and to conceal any uneasiness it
may give you; but, should they be so plain that you
cannot be thought ignorant of their meaning, I would
recommend, rather than quarrel with the company,
joining even in the laugh against yourself; allowing
the jest to be a good one, and take it in seeming good
humour. Never attempt to retaliate the same way,
as that would imply you were hurt. Should what is
said wound your honor, or your moral character, there
is but one proper reply, which I hope you will never
be obliged to have recourse to.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><span class='sc'>Remember</span> there are but two alternatives for a
gentleman; extreme politeness, or the sword. If a
man openly and designedly affronts you, call him out;
but, if it does not amount to an open insult, be outwardly
civil; if this does not make him ashamed of
his behaviour, it will prejudice every by-stander in
your favour, and instead of being disgraced, you will
come off with honor. Politeness to those we do not
respect, is no more a breach of faith, than <i>your humble
servant</i> at the bottom of a challenge; they are universally
understood to be things of course.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Wrangling</span> and quarrelling characterize a weak
mind; leave them to those who love such conduct, be
<i>you</i> always above it. Enter into no sharp contest, and
pride yourself, in shewing, if possible, more civility to
your antagonist than to any other in the company;
this will infallibly bring over all the laughers to your
side, and the person you are contending with, will be
very likely to confess you have behaved very handsomely
throughout the whole affair.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Experience</span> will teach us, that though all men
consist principally of the same materials, as I before
took notice of, yet from a difference in their proportion,
no two men are uniformly the same; we differ
from one another, and we often differ from ourselves,
that is, we sometimes do things utterly inconsistent
with the general tenor of our characters. The wisest
man may occasionally do a weak thing; the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>honest man, a wrong thing; the proudest man, a mean
thing; and the worst of men will sometimes do a good
thing. On this account, our study of mankind should
not be general; we should take a frequent view of individuals,
and though we may upon the whole, form a
judgment of the man from his prevailing passion or
his general character, yet it will be prudent not to
determine, till we have waited to see the operations
of his subordinate appetites and humours.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>For</span> example; a man’s general character may be
that of strictly honest. I would not dispute it, because,
I would not be thought envious or malevolent;
but I would not rely upon this general character, so
as to entrust him with my fortune or my life. Should
this honest man, as is not uncommon, be my rival in
power, interest, or love, he may possibly do things
that in other circumstances he would abhor; and power,
interest, and love, let me tell you, will often put
honesty to the severest trial, and frequently overpower
it. I would then ransack this honest man to the bottom,
if I wished to trust him, and as I found him,
would place my confidence accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>One</span> of the great compositions in our nature is vanity;
to which all men, more or less, give way. Women
have an intolerable share of it. No flattery, no
adulation, is too gross for many of them; those who
flatter them most, please them best; and they are most
in love with him who pretends to be most in love with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>them; and the least slight or contempt of them is seldom
forgotten. It is, in some measure, the same with
men; they will sooner pardon an injury than an insult,
and are more hurt by contempt than by ill usage.
Though all men do not boast of superior talents,
though they pretend not to the abilities of a Pope, a
Newton, or a Bolingbroke, every one pretends to have
common sense, and to discharge his office in life with
common decency; to arraign, therefore, in any shape,
his abilities or integrity, in the department he holds,
is an insult he will not readily forgive.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> I would not have you trust too implicitly to a
man, because the world gives him a good character,
so I must particularly caution you against those who
speak well of themselves. In general, suspect those
who boast of or affect to have any one virtue above all
others, for they are commonly impostors. There are
exceptions however to this rule; for we hear of prudes
that have been chaste, bullies that have been brave,
and saints that have been religious. Confide only
where your own observation shall direct you; observe
not only what is said, but how it is said, and if you
have any penetration, you may find out the truth better
by your eyes than your ears; in short, never take
a character upon common report, but enquire into it
yourself; for common report, though it is right in
general, may be wrong in particulars.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Beware</span> of those who, on a slight acquaintance,
make you a tender of their friendship, and seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>place a confidence in you; it is ten to one but they
deceive and betray you; however, do not rudely reject
them upon such a supposition; you may be civil
to them, though you do not entrust them. Silly men
are apt to solicit your friendship, and unbosom themselves
upon the first acquaintance; such friends cannot
be worth having, their friendship being as slender as
their understanding; and if they proffer their friendship
with a design to make a property of you, they are
dangerous acquaintance indeed. Not but the little
friendships of the weak may be of some use to you, if
you do not return the compliment; and it may not be
amiss to seem to accept of those designing men, keeping
them, as it were, in play, that they may not be
openly your enemies; for their enmity is the next
dangerous thing to their friendship. We may certainly
hold their vices in abhorrence, without being marked
out as their personal enemy. The general rule is,
to have a real reserve with almost every one, and a
seeming reserve with almost no one; for it is very disgusting
to seem reserved, and very dangerous not to
be so. Few observe the true medium. Many are ridiculously
mysterious upon trifles, and many indiscreetly
communicative of all they know.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a kind of short-lived friendship that takes
place among young men, from a connexion in their
pleasures only; a friendship too often attended with
bad consequences. This companion of your pleasures,
young and unexperienced, will probably, in the heat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friendship, and
unfold himself to you without the least reserve; but
new associations, change of fortune, or change of
place, may soon break this ill-timed connexion, and
an improper use may be made of it. Be one, if
you will, in young companies, and bear your part like
others, in all the social festivity of youth; nay, trust
them with your innocent frolicks, but keep your serious
matters to yourself; and if you must at any time
make <i>them</i> known, let it be to some tried friend of
great experience; and that nothing may tempt him
to become your rival, let that friend be in a different
walk of life from yourself.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Were</span> I to hear a man making strong protestations
and swearing to the truth of a thing, that is in itself
probable and very likely to be, I should doubt his veracity;
for when he takes such pains to make me believe
it, it cannot be with a good design.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a certain easiness or false modesty in most
young people, that either makes them unwilling, or
ashamed to refuse any thing that is asked of them.
There is also an unguarded openness about them, that
makes them the ready prey of the artful and designing.
They are easily led away by the feigned friendships of
a knave or a fool, and too rashly place a confidence in
them, that terminates in their loss, and frequently in
their ruin. Beware, therefore, as I said before, of
these proffered friendships; repay them with compliments,
but not with confidence. Never let your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>vanity make you suppose that people become your
friends upon a slight acquaintance; for good offices
must be shewn on both sides to create a friendship: It
will not thrive, unless its love be mutual; and it requires
time to ripen it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is still among young people another kind
of friendship merely nominal; warm indeed for the
time, but fortunately of no long continuance. This
friendship takes its rise from their pursuing the same
course of riot and debauchery; their purses are open
to each other, they tell one another all they know,
they embark in the same quarrels, and stand by each
other on all occasions. I should rather call this a confederacy
against good morals and good manners, and
think it deserves the severest lash of the law; but they
have the impudence to call it friendship. However,
it is often as suddenly dissolved as it is hastily contracted;
some accident disperses them, and they presently
forget each other, except it is to betray, and
to laugh at their own egregious folly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> short, the sum of the whole is, to make a wide
difference between companions and friends; for a very
agreeable companion has often proved a very dangerous
friend.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>CHOICE of COMPANY.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> next thing to the choice of friends, is the
choice of your company.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><span class='sc'>Endeavour</span>, as much as you can, to keep good
company, and the company of your superiors; for
you will be held in estimation according to the company
you keep. By superiors, I do not mean so much
with regard to birth, as merit, and the light in which
they are considered by the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are two sorts of good company, the one
consists of persons of birth, rank, and fashion; the
other, of those who are distinguished by some particular
merit, in any liberal art or science, as men of letters,
&amp;c. and a mixture of these is what I would have
understood by good company: For it is not what particular
sets of people shall call themselves, but what
the people in general acknowledge to be so, and are
the accredited good company of the place.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Now</span> and then, persons without either birth, rank,
or character, will creep into good company, under the
protection of some considerable personage; but, in general,
none are admitted of mean degree, or infamous
moral character.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> this fashionable good company alone, can you
learn the best manners and the best language; for, as
there is no legal standard to form them by, it is here
they are established.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> may possibly be questioned, whether a man has
it always in his power to get into good company; undoubtedly,
by deserving it, he has, provided he is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>circumstances which enable him to live and appear in
the stile of a gentleman. Knowledge, modesty, and
good-breeding, will endear him to all that see him;
for without politeness, the scholar is no better than a
pedant, the philosopher than a cynic, the soldier than
a brute, nor any man than a clown.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Though</span> the company of men of learning and genius
is highly to be valued and occasionally coveted,
I would by no means have you always found in such
company. As they do not live in the world, they
cannot have that easy manner and address, which I
would wish you to acquire. If you can bear a part
in such company, it is certainly advisable to be in it
sometimes, and you will be the more esteemed in other
company by being so; but let it not engross you,
lest you should be considered as one of the <i>literati</i>,
which however respectable in name, is not the way to
rise or shine in the fashionable world.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> the company which, of all others, you should
carefully avoid, is that, which, in every sense of the
word may be called <i>low</i>; low in birth, low in rank,
low in parts, and low in manners; that company,
who, insignificant and contemptible in themselves,
think it an honor to be seen with <i>you</i>, and who will
flatter your follies, nay your very vices, to keep you
with them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Though</span> <i>you</i> may think such a caution unnecessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>I do not; for many a young gentleman of sense and
rank, has been led by his vanity to keep such company,
till he has been degraded, vilified and undone.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> vanity I mean, is that of being the first of the
company. This pride, though too common, is idle
to the last degree. Nothing in the world lets a man
down so much. For the sake of dictating, being applauded
and admired by this low company, he is disgraced
and disqualified for better. Depend upon it,
in the estimation of mankind, you will sink or rise to
the level of the company you keep.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Be</span> it, then, your ambition to get into the best
company; and, when there, imitate their virtues, but
not their vices. You have, no doubt, often heard of
genteel and fashionable vices. These are whoring,
drinking and gaming. It has happened that some
men, even with these vices, have been admired and
esteemed. Understand this matter rightly, it is not
their vices for which they are admired; but for some
accomplishments they at the same time possess; for
their parts, their learning, or their good-breeding.
Be assured, were they free from their vices, they
would be much more esteemed. In these mixed characters,
the bad part is overlooked for the sake of the
good.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Should</span> you be unfortunate enough to have any
vices of your own, add not to their number, by adopting
the vices of others. Vices of adoption are of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>others the most unpardonable; for they have not inadvertency
to plead. If people had no vices but their
own, few would have so many as they have.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Imitate</span>, then, only the perfections you meet
with; copy the politeness, the address, the easy manners
of well-bred people; and remember, let them
shine ever so bright, if they have any vices, they are
so many blemishes, which it would be as ridiculous to
imitate, as it would, to make an artificial wart upon
one’s face, because some very handsome man had the
misfortune to have a natural one upon his.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>LAUGHTER.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Let</span> us now descend to minute matters, which,
though not so important as those we mentioned,
are still far from inconsiderable. Of these laughter is
one.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Frequent</span> and loud laughter is a sure sign of a
weak mind, and no less characteristic of a low education.
It is the manner in which low-bred men express
their silly joy, at silly things, and they call it
being merry.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I do</span> not recommend upon all occasions a solemn
countenance. A man may smile, but if he would be
thought a gentleman and a man of sense, he would by
no means laugh. True wit never made a man of
fashion laugh; he is above it. It may create a smile,
but as loud laughter shews, that a man has not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>command of himself, every one, who would wish to
appear sensible, must abhor it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A man’s</span> going to sit down, on a supposition that
he has a chair behind him, and falling for want of
one, occasions a general laugh, when the best pieces
of wit would not do it; a sufficient proof how low
and unbecoming laughter is.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Besides</span>, could the immoderate laugher hear his
own noise, or see the faces he makes, he would despise
himself for his folly. Laughter being generally
supposed to be the effects of gaiety, its absurdity is
not properly attended to; but a little reflection will
easily restrain it; and when you are told, it is a mark
of low-breeding, I persuade myself you will endeavour
to avoid it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Some</span> people have a silly trick of laughing, whenever
they speak; so that they are always on the grin,
and their faces ever distorted. This and a thousand
other tricks, such as scratching their heads, twirling
their hats, fumbling with their button, playing with
their fingers, &amp;c. &amp;c. are acquired from a false modesty,
at their first outset in life. Being shame-faced
in company, they try a variety of ways to keep themselves
in countenance; thus, they fall into those awkward
habits I have mentioned, which grow upon them,
and in time become habitual.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Nothing</span> is more repugnant likewise to good-breeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>than horse play of any sort, romping, throwing
things at one another’s heads, and so on. They
may pass well enough with the mob, but they lessen
and degrade the gentleman.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>SUNDRY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>I have</span> had reason to observe before, that various
little matters, apparently trifling in themselves,
conspire to form the <i>whole</i> of pleasing, as, in a
well finished portrait, a variety of colours combine to
compleat the piece. It not being necessary to dwell
much upon them, I shall content myself, with just
mentioning them as they occur.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <span class='sc'>To</span> do the honors of a table gracefully, is one
of the outlines of a well-bred man; and to carve
well, is an article, little as it may seem, that is useful
twice every day, and the doing of which ill, is not
only troublesome to one’s self, but renders us disagreeable
and ridiculous to others. We are always in
pain for a man, who instead of cutting up a fowl genteely,
is hacking for half an hour across the bone,
greasing himself, and bespattering the company with
the sauce. Use, with a little attention, is all that is
requisite to acquit yourself well in this particular.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <span class='sc'>To</span> be well received, you must, also, pay some
attention to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly
rude to scratch any part of your body, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>spit, or blow your nose, if you can possibly avoid it,
to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the table, to
pick your teeth before the dishes are removed, or to
leave the table before grace is said.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <span class='sc'>Drinking</span> of healths is now growing out of
fashion, and is very unpolite in good company. Custom
had once made it universal, but the improved
manners of the age now render it vulgar. What can
be more rude or ridiculous than to interrupt persons
at their meals, with an unnecessary compliment? Abstain
then from this silly custom, where you find it out
of use; and use it only at those tables where it continues
general.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “<span class='sc'>A polite</span>” manner of refusing to comply with the
solicitations of a company, is also very necessary to be
learnt; for, a young man, who seems to have no will
of his own, but does every thing that is asked of him,
may be a very good natured fellow, but he is a very
silly one. If you are invited to drink at any man’s
house, more than you think is wholesome, you may
say, ‘you wish you could, but that so little makes
you both drunk and sick, that you should only be
bad company by doing it; of course beg to be excused.’
If desired to play at cards deeper than you
would, refuse it ludicrously; tell them, ‘if you were
sure to lose, you might possibly sit down; but that,
as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought
of having too much money, ever since you found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and
therefore you are resolved never to put yourself in
the way of winning more than such or such a sum a
day.’ This light way of declining invitations, to
vice and folly, is more becoming a young man than
philosophical or sententious refusals, which would only
be laughed at.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <span class='sc'>Now</span> I am on the subject of cards, I must not
omit mentioning the necessity of playing them well
and genteely, if you would be thought to have kept
good company. I would by no means recommend
playing of cards as a part of your study, lest you
should grow too fond of it, and the consequences
prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond
from a club, than to become a gambler; but as custom
has introduced innocent card-playing at most
friendly meetings, it marks the gentleman to handle
them genteely, and play them well; and as I hope
you will play only for small sums, should you lose
your money, pray lose it with temper; or win, receive
your winnings without either elation or greediness.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <span class='sc'>To</span> write well and correct, and in a pleasing
stile, is another part of polite education. Every man
who has the use of his eyes and his right hand, can
write whatever hand he pleases. Nothing is so illiberal
as a school-boy’s scrawl. I would not have you
learn a stiff formal hand-writing, like that of a schoolmaster,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>but a genteel, legible and liberal hand, and to
be able to write quick. As to the correctness and
elegancy of your writing, attention to grammar does
the one, and to the best authors, the other. Epistolary
correspondence should not be carried on in a studied
or affected style, but the language should flow
from the pen, as naturally and as easily as it would
from the mouth. In short, a letter should be penned
in the same style, as you would talk to your friend, if
he were present.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. <span class='sc'>If</span> writing well shews the gentleman, much more
so does spelling well. It is essentially necessary for a
gentleman, or a man of letters; one false spelling
may fix a ridicule on him for the remainder of his
life. Words in books are generally well spelled, according
to the orthography of the age; reading
therefore, with attention, will teach every one to spell
right. It sometimes happens that words are spelled
differently by different authors; but if you spell them
upon the authority of one, in estimation of the public,
you will escape ridicule. Where there is but one way
of spelling a word, by your spelling it wrong, you
will be sure to be laughed at. For a <i>woman</i> of a tolerable
education would laugh at and despise her lover,
if he wrote to her, and the words were ill spelled. Be
particularly attentive then to your spelling.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. <span class='sc'>There</span> is nothing that a young man, at his
first appearance in life, ought more to dread, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>having any ridicule fixed on him. In the estimation
even of the most rational men, it will lessen him, but
ruin him with all the rest. Many have been undone
by a ridiculous nick-name. The causes of
nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the
little defects in manner, air, or address. To have the
appellation of ill-bred, awkward, muttering, left-legged,
or any other, tacked always to your name,
would injure you more than you are aware of. Avoid
then these little defects (and they are easily avoided)
and you need never fear a nick-name.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. <span class='sc'>Some</span> young men are apt to think, that they
cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men
of pleasure; and the rake they often mistake for the
man of pleasure. A rake is made up of the meanest
and most disgraceful vices. They all combine to degrade
his character, and ruin his health and fortune.
A man of pleasure will refine upon the enjoyments
of the age, attend them with decency, and partake of
them becomingly. Indeed, he is too often less scrupulous
than he should be, and frequently has cause to
repent it. A man of pleasure, at best, is but a dissipated
being, and what the rational part of mankind
must abhor; I mention it, however, lest in taking up
the man of pleasure, you should fall into the rake;
for of two evils, always chuse the least. A dissolute,
flagitious footman may make as good a rake as a man
of the first quality. Few men can be men of pleasure;
every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>that should be preserved in all our pleasures: In love,
a man may lose his heart, without losing his nose; at
table, a man may have a distinguishing palate, without
being a glutton; he may love wine, without being
a drunkard; he may game, without being a gambler;
and so on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and
every pleasure its neighbouring disgrace. Temperance
and moderation mark the gentleman; but excess
the blackguard. Attend carefully, then, to the
line that divides them; and remember, stop rather a
yard short, than step an inch beyond it. Weigh the
present enjoyment of your pleasures against the necessary
consequences of them, and I will leave you to
your own determination.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. <span class='sc'>A gentleman</span> has ever some regard also to the
<i>choice</i> of his amusements; if at cards, he will not be
seen at cribbage, all-fours, or put; or, in sports of
exercise, at skittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving
of coaches, &amp;c. but will preserve a propriety in
every part of his conduct; knowing that any imitation
of the manners of the mob, will unavoidably stamp
him with vulgarity. There is another amusement
too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is,
playing upon any musical instrument. Music is commonly
reckoned one of the liberal arts, and undoubtedly
is so; but to be piping or fiddling at a concert
is degrading to a man of fashion. If you love music,
hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle
yourself. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>contemptible, leads him frequently into bad company,
and wastes that time which might otherwise be well
employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. <span class='sc'>Secrecy</span> is another characteristic of good-breeding.
Be careful never to tell in one company
what you see or hear in another; much less to divert
the present company at the expense of the last. Things
apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and
told abroad, have much more serious consequences
than imagined. In conversation, there is generally a
tacit reliance, that what is said will not be repeated;
and a man, though not enjoined to secrecy, will be
excluded company, if found to be a tatler;  besides,
he will draw himself into a thousand scrapes, and every
one will be afraid to speak before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. <span class='sc'>Pulling</span> out your watch in company unasked,
either at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if
at home, it appears as if you were tired of your company,
and wished them to be gone; if abroad, as if the
hours dragged heavily, and wished to be gone yourself.
If you want to know the time, withdraw; besides,
as the taking what is called French leave was
introduced, that on one person’s leaving the company
the rest might not be disturbed, looking at your watch
does what that piece of politeness was designed to prevent;
it is a kind of dictating to all present, and telling
them it is time, or almost time to break up.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. <span class='sc'>Among</span> other things, let me caution you against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>ever being in a hurry; a man of sense may be in haste,
but he is never in a hurry; convinced that hurry is
the surest way to make him do what he undertakes ill.
To be in a hurry is a proof that the business we embark
in is too great for us; of course it is the mark of
little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when
they should be cool and deliberate; they want to do
every thing at once, and therefore do nothing. Be
steady, then, in all your engagements; look round
you, before you begin; and remember that you had
better do half of them well, and leave the rest undone,
than to do the whole indifferently.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. <span class='sc'>From</span> a kind of false modesty, most young men
are apt to consider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardness
I allow is so; but there is a decent familiarity
that is necessary in the course of life. Mere formal
visits, upon formal invitations, are not the thing;
they create no connexion, nor will they prove of service
to you; it is the careless and easy ingress and
egress, at all hours, that secures an acquaintance to our
interest; and this is acquired by a respectful familiarity
entered into, without forfeiting your consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. <span class='sc'>In</span> acquiring new acquaintance, be careful not
to neglect your old, for a slight of this kind is seldom
forgiven. If you cannot be with your former acquaintance,
so often as you used to be, while you had
no others, take care not to give them cause to think
you neglect them; call upon them frequently, though
you cannot stay long with them; tell them you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>sorry to leave them so soon, and nothing should take
you away but certain engagements which good manners
oblige you to attend to; for it will be your interest
to make all the friends you can, and as few enemies
as possible. By friends, I would not be understood
to mean confidential ones; but persons who
speak of you respectfully, and who, consistent with
their own interest, would wish to be of service to you,
and would rather do you good than harm.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. <span class='sc'>Another</span> thing I must recommend to you, as
characteristic of a polite education, and of having kept
good company, is a graceful manner of conferring favours.
The most obliging things may be done so
awkwardly as to offend, while the most disagreeable
things may be done so agreeably as to please.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. <span class='sc'>A few</span> more articles and then I have done;
the first is on the subject of vanity. It is the common
failing of youth, and as such ought to be carefully
guarded against. The vanity I mean, is that which,
if given way to, stamps a man a coxcomb, a character
he will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as long
as he lives. Now this vanity shews itself in a variety
of shapes; one man shall pride himself in taking the
lead in all conversations, and peremptorily deciding
upon every subject; another, desirous of appearing
successful among the women, shall insinuate the encouragement
he has met with, the conquests he makes,
and perhaps boasts of favours he never received; if
he speaks truth, he is ungenerous; if false, he is a villain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>but whether true or false, he defeats his own
purposes, overthrows the reputation he wishes to erect,
and draws upon himself contempt in the room of respect.
Some men are vain enough to think they acquire
consequence by alliance, or by an acquaintance
with persons of distinguished character or abilities;
hence they are eternally talking of their grand-father,
Lord such-a-one; their kinsman, Sir William such-a-one;
or their intimate friend, Dr. such-a-one, with
whom perhaps, they are scarcely acquainted. If they
are ever found out (and that they are sure to be one
time or another) they become ridiculous and contemptible;
but even admitting what they say to be true,
what then? A man’s intrinsic merit does not rise from
an ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance.
A rich man never borrows. When angling for praise,
modesty is the surest bait. If we would wish to shine
in any particular character, we must never affect that
character. An affectation of courage will make a man
pass for a bully; an affectation of wit, for a coxcomb;
and an affectation of sense, for a fool. Not that I
would recommend bashfulness or timidity: No; I
would have every one know his own value, yet not
discover that he knows it, but leave his merit to be
found out by others.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. <span class='sc'>Another</span> thing worth your attention is, if in
company with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority;
if he discovers it himself, without your endeavours,
the fault is not yours, and he will not blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make
him feel himself inferior to you in abilities, fortune,
or rank, it is an insult that will not readily be forgiven.
In point of abilities, it would be unjust, as they are
out of his power; in point of rank or fortune, it is
ill-natured and ill-bred. This rule is never more necessary
than at table, where there cannot be a greater
insult than to help an inferior to a part he dislikes, or
a part that may be worse than ordinary, and to take
the best to yourself. If you at any time invite an inferior
to your table, you put him, during the time he
is there, upon an equality with you; and it is an act
of the highest rudeness to treat him in any respect,
slightingly. I would rather double my attention to
such a person, and treat him with additional respect,
lest he should even suppose himself neglected. There
cannot be a greater savageness, or cruelty, or any thing
more degrading to a man of fashion than to put upon
or take unbecoming liberties with him, whose modesty,
humility, or respect, will not suffer him to retaliate.
True politeness consists in making every body happy
about you; and as to mortify is to render unhappy,
it can be nothing but the worst of breeding. Make it
a rule, rather to flatter a person’s vanity than otherwise;
make him, if possible, more in love with himself,
and you will be certain to gain his esteem; never tell
him any thing he may not like to hear, nor say things
that will put him out of countenance, but let it be
your study on all occasions to please; this will be
making friends instead of enemies, and be a mean of
serving yourself in the end.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>19. <span class='sc'>Never</span> be witty, at the expense of any one present,
nor gratify that idle inclination which is too
strong in most young men, I mean laughing at, or
ridiculing the weaknesses or infirmities of others, by
way of diverting the company, or displaying your own
superiority. Most people have their weaknesses, their
peculiar likings and aversions. Some cannot bear the
sight of a cat; others the smell of cheese, and so on;
were you to laugh at these men for their antipathies, or
by design or inattention to bring them in their way,
you could not insult them more. You may possibly
thus gain the laugh on your side, for the present, but
it will make the person, perhaps, at whose expense you
are merry, your enemy forever after; and even those
who laugh with you, will on a little reflection, fear
you and probably despise you; whereas, to procure
what <i>one</i> likes, and to remove what the <i>other</i> hates,
would shew them that they were the objects of your
attention, and possibly make them more your friends
than much greater services would have done. If you
have wit, use it to please but not to hurt. You may
shine, but take care not to scorch. In short, never
seem to see the faults of others. Though among the
mass of men there are, doubtless, numbers of fools
and knaves, yet were we to tell every one we meet
with, that we know them to be so, we should be in
perpetual war. I would detest the knave and pity the
fool, wherever I found him, but I would let neither of
them know unnecessarily that I did so; as I would
not be industrious to make myself enemies. As one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>must please others then, in order to be pleased one’s
self, consider what is agreeable to you, must be agreeable
to them, and conduct yourself accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. <span class='sc'>Whispering</span> in company is another act of
ill-breeding: It seems to insinuate either that the persons
who we would not wish should hear, are unworthy
of our confidence, or it may lead them to
suppose we are speaking improperly of them; on both
accounts, therefore, abstain from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. <span class='sc'>So</span> pulling out one letter after another and reading
them in company, or cutting and paring one’s
nails, is unpolite and rude. It seems to say, we are
weary of the conversation, and are in want of some
amusement to pass away the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. <span class='sc'>Humming</span> a tune to ourselves, drumming with
our fingers on the table, making a noise with our feet,
and such like, are all breaches of good manners, and
indications of our contempt for the persons present;
therefore they should not be indulged.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. <span class='sc'>Walking</span> fast in the streets is a mark of vulgarity,
implying hurry of business; it may appear
well in a mechanic or tradesman, but suits ill with the
character of a gentleman, or a man of fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. <span class='sc'>Staring</span> at any person you meet full in the
face, is an act also of ill-breeding; it looks as if you
saw something wonderful in his appearance, and is
therefore a tacit reprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>25. <span class='sc'>Eating</span> quick, or very slow at meals, is characteristic
of the vulgar; the first infers poverty, that
you have not had a good meal for some time; the last,
if abroad, that you dislike your entertainment; if at
home, that you are rude enough to set before your
friends what you cannot eat yourself. So again, eating
your soup with your nose in the plate is vulgar;
it has the appearance of being used to hard work, and
of course an unsteady hand. If it be necessary then to
avoid this, it is much more so that of smelling your
meat.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. <span class='sc'>Smelling</span> to the meat while on the fork, before
you put it in your mouth. I have seen many an
ill-bred fellow do this, and have been so angry, that
I could have kicked him from the table. If you dislike
what you have upon your plate, leave it; but on
no account, by smelling to, or examining it, charge
your friend with putting unwholesome provisions before
you.</p>

<p class='c006'>27. <span class='sc'>Spitting</span> on the carpet is a nasty practice,
and shocking, in a man of liberal education. Were
this to become general, it would be as necessary to
change the carpets as the table-cloths; besides, it will
lead our acquaintance to suppose, that we have not
been used to genteel furniture; for this reason alone,
if for no other, by all means avoid it.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. <span class='sc'>Keep</span> yourself free likewise from odd tricks or
habits, such as thrusting out your tongue continually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>snapping your fingers, rubbing your hands, sighing aloud,
an affected shivering of your whole body, gaping
with a noise like a country-fellow that has been sleeping
in a hay-loft, or indeed with any noise, and many
others, which I have noticed before; these are imitations
of the manners of the mob, and are degrading to
a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A very</span> little attention will get the better of all these
ill-bred habits, and be assured, you will find your account
in it.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>EMPLOYMENT of TIME.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Employment</span> of time, is a subject, that
from its importance, deserves your best attention.
Most young gentlemen have a great deal of time before
them, and one hour well employed, in the early part
of life, is more valuable and will be of greater use to
you, than perhaps four and twenty, some years to
come.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Whatever</span> time you can steal from company, and
from the study of the world; (I say company, for a
knowledge of life is best learned in various companies)
employ it in serious reading. Take up some valuable
book, and continue the reading of that book, till you
have got through it; never burden your mind with
more than one thing at a time: And in reading this
book don’t run over it superficially, but read every passage
twice over, at least do not pass on to a second till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>you thoroughly understand the first, nor quit the book
till you are master of the subject; for unless you do this,
you may read it through, and not remember the contents
of it for a week. The books I would particularly
recommend, among others, are, <i>Cardinal Retz’s
Maxims</i>, <i>Rochfaucault’s Moral Reflections</i>, <i>Bruyere’s Characters</i>,
<i>Fontenell’s Plurality of Worlds</i>, <i>Sir Josiah Child
on Trade</i>, <i>Bolingbroke’s Works</i>; for style, his <i>Remarks
on the History of England</i>, under the name of Sir John
Oldcastle; <i>Puffendorf’s Jus Gentium</i>, <i>and Grotius’ de
Jure Belli et Pacis</i>: The last two are well translated by
Barboyrac. For occasional half-hours or less, read
the best works of invention, wit and humour; but
never waste your minutes on trifling authors, either
ancient or modern.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Any</span> business you may have to transact, should be
done the first opportunity, and finished, if possible
without interruption; for by deferring it, we may probably
finish it too late, or execute it indifferently.
Now, business of any kind should never be done by
halves, but every part of it should be well attended to:
For he that does business ill, had better not do it at
all. And, in any point, which discretion bids you
pursue, and which has a manifest utility to recommend
it, let no difficulties deter you; rather let them
animate your industry. If one method fails, try a
second and a third. Be active, persevere and you will
certainly conquer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><span class='sc'>Never</span> indulge a lazy disposition; there are few
things but are attended with some difficulties, and if
you are frightened at those difficulties, you will not
compleat any thing. Indolent minds prefer ignorance
to trouble; they look upon most things as impossible,
because perhaps they are difficult. Even an hour’s
attention is too laborious for them, and they would
rather content themselves with the first view of things,
than take the trouble to look any farther into them.
Thus, when they come to talk upon subjects to those
who have studied them, they betray an unpardonable
ignorance, and lay themselves open to answers that
confuse them. Be careful then, that you do not get
the appellation of indolent; and, if possible, avoid the
character of frivolous. For,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> frivolous mind is always busied upon nothing.
It mistakes trifling objects for important ones, and
spends that time upon little matters, that should only
be bestowed upon great ones. Knick-knacks, butterflies,
shells, and such like, engross the attention of
the frivolous man, and fill up all his time. He studies
the dress and not the characters of men, and his subjects
of conversation are no other than the weather, his
own domestic affairs, his servants, his method of managing
his family, the little anecdotes of the neighbourhood,
and the fiddle-faddle stories of the day;
void of information, void of improvement. These he
relates with emphasis, as interesting matters; in short,
he is a male gossip, I appeal to your own feelings now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>whether such things do not lessen a man, in the opinion
of his acquaintance, and instead of attracting esteem,
create disgust.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>DIGNITY of MANNERS.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a certain dignity of manners, without
which the very best characters will not be
valued.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Romping</span>, loud and frequent laughing, punning,
joking, mimickry, waggery, and too great and indiscriminate
familiarity, will render any one contemptible,
in spite of all his knowledge or his merit. These
may constitute a merry fellow, but a merry fellow was
never yet respectable. Indiscriminate familiarity, will
either offend your superiors, or make you pass for their
dependant, or toad-eater, and it will put your inferiors
on a degree of equality with you, that may be troublesome.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A joke</span>, if it carries a sting along with it, is no
longer a joke but an affront; and even if it has no
sting, unless its witticism is delicate and facetious,
instead of giving pleasure, it will disgust; or, if the
company <i>should</i> laugh, they will probably laugh at the
jester rather than the jest.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Punning</span> is a mere playing upon words, and far
from being a mark of sense: Thus, were we to say,
such a dress is <i>commodious</i>, one of these wags would
answer <i>odious</i>; or, that, whatever it has been, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>now be <i>commodious</i>. Others will give us an answer
different from what we should expect, without either
wit, or the least beauty of thought; as, ‘<i>Where’s
my Lord?</i>’—‘<i>In his clothes, unless he is in bed.</i>’—‘<i>How
does this wine taste?</i>’—‘<i>A little moist, I think.</i>’—‘<i>How
is this to be eaten?</i>’—‘<i>With your mouth</i>;’ and so on, all
which (you will readily apprehend) are low and vulgar.
If your witticisms are not instantly approved by the
laugh of the company, for heaven’s sake, don’t attempt
to be witty for the future; for you may take it for
granted, the defect is in yourself, and not in your
hearers.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> to a mimick or a wag, he is little else than a
buffoon, who will distort his mouth and his eyes to
make people laugh. Be assured, no one person ever
demeaned himself to please the rest, unless he wished
to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company,
and whether this character is respectable, I will leave
you to judge.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> a man’s company is coveted on any other account
than his knowledge, his good sense, or his manners,
he is seldom respected by those who invite him, but
made use of only to entertain. ‘Let’s have such-a-one,
for he sings a good song, or he is always joking or
laughing;’ or ‘Let’s send for such-a-one, for he is
a good bottle companion;’ these are degrading distinctions,
that preclude all respect and esteem. Whoever
is had (as the phrase is) for the sake of any qualification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>singly, is merely that thing he is had for, is
never considered in any other light, and, of course,
never properly respected, let his intrinsic merits be
what they will.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> may possibly suppose this dignity of manners
to border upon pride; but it differs as much from
pride, as true courage from blustering.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To</span> flatter a person right or wrong, is abject flattery,
and to consent readily to do every thing proposed by
a company, be it silly or criminal, is full as degrading,
as to dispute warmly upon every subject, and to contradict
upon all occasions. To preserve dignity, we
should modestly assert our own sentiments, though we
politely acquiesce in those of others.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>So</span> again, to support dignity of character, we should
neither be frivolously curious about trifles, nor be laboriously
intent upon little objects that deserve not a
moment’s attention; for this implies an incapacity in
matters of greater importance.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A great</span> deal likewise depends upon our air, address
and expressions; an awkward address and vulgar
expressions infer either a low turn of mind, or low
education.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Insolent</span> contempt, or low envy, is incompatible
also with dignity of manners. Low-bred persons, fortunately
lifted in the world in fine clothes and fine
equipages, will insolently look down on all those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>cannot afford to make as good an appearance, and
they openly envy those who perhaps make a better.
They also dread the being slighted; of course, are
suspicious and captious; are uneasy themselves, and
make every body else so about them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A certain</span> degree of outward seriousness in looks
and actions gives dignity, while a constant smirk upon
the face (that insipid silly smile, which fools have when
they would be civil) and whiffling motions, are strong
marks of futility.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> above all a dignity of character is to be acquired
best by a certain firmness in all our actions. A mean,
timid and passive complaisance, lets a man down more
than he is aware of; but still his firmness and resolution
should not extend to brutality, but be accompanied
with a peculiar and engaging softness, or mildness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you discover any hastiness in your temper, and
find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded
expressions, watch it narrowly, and endeavour to curb
it; but let no complaisance, no weak desire of pleasing,
no wheedling, urge you to do that which discretion
forbids; but persist and persevere in all that is
right. In your connexions and friendships, you will
find this rule of use to you. Invite and preserve attachments
by your firmness; but labour to keep clear of
enemies by a mildness of behaviour. Disarm those
enemies you may unfortunately have (and few are
without them) by a gentleness of manner, but make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>them feel the steadiness of your just resentment! For
there is a wide difference between bearing malice and
a determined self-defence; the one is imperious, but
the other is prudent and justifiable.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> directing your servants, or any person you have
a right to command; if you deliver your orders mildly,
and in that engaging manner which every gentleman
should study to do, you would be cheerfully, and consequently,
well obeyed; but if tyrannically, you would
be very unwillingly served, if served at all. A cool,
steady determination should shew that you will be
obeyed, but a gentleness in the manner of enforcing
that obedience should make your service a cheerful
one. Thus will you be loved without being despised,
and feared without being hated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I hope</span> I need not mention vices. A man who
has patiently been kicked out of company, may have
as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered infamous
by his vices, may to dignity of any kind; however,
of such consequence are appearances, that an
outward decency and an affected dignity of manners
will even keep such a man the longer from sinking.
If therefore you should unfortunately have no intrinsic
merit of your own, keep up, if possible, the appearance
of it; and the world will possibly give you credit for
the rest. A versatility of manners is as necessary in
social life, as a versatility of parts in political. This
is no way blamable, if not used with an ill design.
We must, like the cameleon, often put on the hue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>persons we wish to be well with; and it surely can
never be blamable, to endeavour to gain the good will
or affection of any one, if when obtained, we do not
mean to abuse it.</p>
<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>RULES for CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Having</span> now given you full and sufficient
instructions for making you well received in the
best companies; nothing remains but that I lay before
you some few rules for your conduct in such company.
Many things on this subject I have mentioned
before, but some few matters remain to be mentioned
now.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <span class='sc'>Talk</span>, then, frequently but not long together,
lest you tire the persons you are speaking to; for few
persons talk so well upon a subject, as to keep up the
attention of their hearers for any length of time.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <span class='sc'>Avoid</span> telling stories in company, unless they
are very short indeed, and very applicable to the subject
you are upon; in this case relate them in as few
words as possible, without the least digression, and
with some apology; as that you hate the telling of
stories, but the shortness of it induced you. And, if
your story has any wit in it, be particularly careful not
to laugh at it yourself. Nothing is more tiresome and
disagreeable than a long tedious narrative; it betrays
a gossiping disposition, and great want of imagination;
and nothing is more ridiculous than to express an approbation
of your own story, by a laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>3. <span class='sc'>In</span> relating any thing, keep clear of repetitions,
or very hackneyed expressions, such as, <i>says he</i>, or <i>says
she</i>. Some people will use these so often, as to take
off the hearer’s attention from the story; as, in an organ
out of tune, one pipe shall perhaps sound the whole
time we are playing, and confuse the piece, so as not
to be understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <span class='sc'>Digressions</span>, likewise, should be guarded
against. A story is always more agreeable without
them. Of this kind are, ‘<i>the gentleman I am telling you
of, is the son of Sir Thomas,—who lives in Harley street;
you must know him—his brother had a horse that won the
sweep stakes at the last Newmarket meeting—Zounds! if
you don’t know him you know nothing.</i>’ Or, ‘<i>He was
an upright tall old gentleman, who wore his own long
hair: don’t you recollect him?</i>’ All this is unnecessary;
is very tiresome and provoking, and would be an
excuse for a man’s behaviour, if he was to leave us in
the midst of our narrative.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <span class='sc'>Some</span> people have a trick of holding the persons
they are speaking to by the button, or the hand, in
order to be heard out; conscious, I suppose, that their
tale is tiresome. Pray, never do this; if the person
you speak to is not as willing to hear your story, as
you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the
middle; for if you tire them once, they will be afraid
to listen to you a second time.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <span class='sc'>Others</span> have a way of punching the person they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>are talking to, in the side, and at the end of every sentence,
asking him some such questions as the following:
‘Wasn’t I right in that?’—‘You know, I told you
so?’—‘What’s your opinion?’ and the like; or perhaps
they will be thrusting him, or jogging him with
their elbow. For mercy’s sake, never give way to
this; it will make your company dreaded.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. <span class='sc'>Long</span> talkers are frequently apt to single out
some unfortunate man present, generally the most silent
one of the company, or probably him who sits next to
him. To this man, in a kind of half-whisper they will
run on for half an hour together. Nothing can be
more ill-bred. But if one of these unmerciful talkers
should attack you, if you wish to oblige him, I would
recommend the hearing him with patience: Seem to
do so at least, for you could not hurt him more than
to leave him in the middle of his story, or discover any
impatience in the course of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. <span class='sc'>Incessant</span> talkers are very disagreeable companions.
Nothing can be more rude than to engross
the conversation to yourself, or to take the words as it
were, out of another man’s mouth. Every man in
company has an equal claim to bear his part in the conversation,
and to deprive him of it, is not only unjust,
but a tacit declaration that he cannot speak so well
upon the subject as yourself; you will therefore take
it up: And, what can be more rude? I would as soon
forgive a man that should stop my mouth when I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>gaping, as take my words from me while I was speaking
them. Now, if this be unpardonable, it cannot be
less so</p>

<p class='c006'>9. <span class='sc'>To</span> help out or forestal the slow speaker, as if you
alone were rich in expressions, and he were poor. You
may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to
think he can talk well, though he may modestly deny
it; helping a person therefore out in his expressions,
is a correction that will stamp the corrector with impudence
and ill manners.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. <span class='sc'>Those</span> who contradict others upon all occasions,
and make every assertion a matter of dispute, betray
by this behaviour an unacquaintance with good-breeding.
He therefore who wishes to appear amiable, with
those he converses with, will be cautious of such expressions
as these, ‘That can’t be true, Sir.’ ‘The affair
is as I say.’ ‘That must be false, Sir.’ ‘If what
you say is true, &amp;c.’ You may as well tell a man he
lies at once, as thus indirectly impeach his veracity.
It is equally as rude to be proving every trifling assertion
with a bet or a wager. ‘I’ll bet you fifty of it,
and so on.’ Make it then a constant rule, in matters
of no great importance, complaisantly to submit your
opinion to that of others; for a victory of this kind
often costs a man the loss of a friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. <span class='sc'>Giving</span> advice unasked, is another piece of
rudeness; it is, in effect, declaring ourselves wiser than
those to whom we give it; reproaching them with ignorance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought
not to be taken with any common acquaintance, and
yet there are those, who will be offended, if their advice
is not taken. ‘Such-a-one,’ say they, ‘is above
being advised.’ ‘He scorns to listen to my advice;’
as if it were not a mark of greater arrogance to expect
every one to submit to their opinion, than for a man
sometimes to follow his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. <span class='sc'>There</span> is nothing so unpardonably rude as a
seeming inattention to the person who is speaking to you;
though you may meet with it in others, by all means,
avoid it yourself. Some ill-bred people, while others
are speaking to them, will, instead of looking at, or
attending to them, perhaps fix their eyes on the ceiling,
or some picture in the room, look out of a window,
play with a dog, their watch chain, or their cane, or
probably pick their nails or their noses. Nothing
betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor can any
thing be a greater affront to the person speaking; it
being a tacit declaration, that what he is saying is not
worth your attention. Consider with yourself how
you would like such treatment, and, I am persuaded
you will never shew it to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. <span class='sc'>Surliness</span> or moroseness is incompatible also
with politeness. Such as, should any one say ‘he was
desired to present Mr. Such-a-one’s respects to you,’
to reply, ‘What the devil have I to do with his respects?’
‘My Lord enquired after you lately, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>asked how you did,’ to answer, ‘If he wishes to
know, let him come and feel my pulse;’ and the
like. A good deal of this often is affected; but whether
affected or natural, it is always offensive. A man
of this stamp will occasionally be laughed at, as an oddity;
but in the end will be despised.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. <span class='sc'>I should</span> suppose it unnecessary to advise you
to adapt your conversation to the company you are in.
You would not surely start the same subject, and discourse
of it in the same manner with the old and with
the young, with an officer, a clergyman, a philosopher,
and a woman. No; your good sense will undoubtedly
teach you to be serious with the serious, gay with the
gay, and to trifle with the triflers.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. <span class='sc'>There</span> are certain expressions which are exceedingly
rude, and yet there are people of liberal
education that sometimes use them; as ‘You don’t
understand me, Sir,’ ‘It is not so.’ ‘You mistake.’
‘You know nothing of the matter, &amp;c.’ Is it not better
to say? ‘I believe, I do not express myself so as to be
understood.’ ‘Let us consider it again, whether we
take it right or not.’ It is much more polite and amiable
to make some excuse for another, even in cases
where he might justly be blamed, and to represent the
mistake as common to both, rather than charge him
with insensibility or incomprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. <span class='sc'>If</span> anyone should have promised you any thing,
and not have fulfilled that promise, it would be very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>unpolite to tell him, he has forfeited his word; or if
the same person should have disappointed you, upon
any occasion, would it not be better to say, ‘You were
probably so much engaged, that you forgot my affair;’
or, ‘Perhaps it slipped your memory;’ rather
than, ‘You thought no more about it,’ or ‘you pay
very little regard to your word.’ For, expressions of
this kind leave a sting behind them. They are a kind
of provocation and affront, and very often bring on lasting
quarrels.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. <span class='sc'>Be</span> careful not to appear dark and mysterious,
lest you should be thought suspicious; than which
there cannot be a more unamiable character. If you
appear mysterious and reserved, others will be truly
so with you; and in this case there is an end to improvement,
for you will gather no information. Be
reserved, but never seem so.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. <span class='sc'>There</span> is a fault extremely common with some
people, which I would have <i>you</i> to avoid. When their
opinion is asked, upon any subject, they will give it
with so apparent a diffidence and timidity, that one
cannot, without the utmost pain, listen to them; especially
if they are known to be men of universal knowledge.
‘Your Lordship will pardon me,’ says one of
this stamp, ‘if I should not be able to speak to the
case in hand, so well as it might be wished.’—‘I’ll
venture to speak of this matter to the best of my poor
abilities and dulness of apprehension.’—‘I fear I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>expose myself, but in obedience to your Lordship’s
commands’—and while they are making these apologies,
they interrupt the business and tire the company.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. <span class='sc'>Always</span> look people in the face, when you
speak to them, otherwise you will be thought conscious
of some guilt, besides, you lose the opportunity of
reading their countenances, from which you will much
better learn the impression your discourse makes upon
them than you can possibly do from their words; for
words are at the will of every one, but the countenance
is frequently involuntary.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. <span class='sc'>If</span> in speaking to a person, you are not heard,
and should be desired to repeat what you said, do not
raise your voice in the repetition, lest you should be
thought angry, on being obliged to repeat what you
said before; it was probably owing to the hearer’s
inattention.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. <span class='sc'>One</span> word only, as to swearing. Those who
addict themselves to it, and interlard their discourse
with oaths, can never be considered as gentlemen; they
are generally people of low education, and are unwelcome
in what is called good company. It is a vice
that has no temptation to plead, but is, in every respect,
as vulgar as it is wicked.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. <span class='sc'>Never</span> accustom yourself to scandal, nor listen
to it; for though it may gratify the malevolence of
some people, nine times out of ten, it is attended with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>great disadvantages. The very persons you tell it to,
will, on reflection, entertain a mean opinion of you,
and it will often bring you into very disagreeable situations.
And as there would be no evil speakers, if
there were no evil hearers, it is in scandal as in robbery;
the receiver is as bad as the thief. Besides, it will
lead people to shun your company, supposing that you
will speak ill of them to the next acquaintance you
meet.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. <span class='sc'>Mimickry</span>, the favourite amusement of little
minds, has been ever the contempt of great ones.
Never give way to it yourself, nor ever encourage it
in others; it is the most illiberal of all buffoonery; it
is an insult on the person you mimick; and insults, I
have often told you, are seldom forgiven.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. <span class='sc'>Carefully</span> avoid talking either of your own
or other people’s domestic concerns. By doing the
one, you will be thought vain; by entering into the
other, you will be considered as officious. Talking
of yourself is an impertinence to the company; your
affairs are nothing to them; besides they cannot be
kept too secret. And as to the affairs of others, what
are they to you? In talking of matters that no way
concern you, you are liable to commit blunders, and
should you touch any one in a sore part, you may possibly
lose his esteem. Let your conversation, then, in
mixed companies, always be general.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. <span class='sc'>Jokes</span>, bon-mots, or the little pleasantries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>one company, will not often bear to be told in another;
they are frequently local, and take their rise from
certain circumstances, a second company may not be
acquainted with; these circumstances, and of course
your story, may be misunderstood, or want explaining;
and if after you have prefaced it with,—‘I will tell you
a good thing;’—the sting should not be immediately
perceived, you will appear exceedingly ridiculous, and
wish you had not told it. Never then without caution
repeat in one place, what you hear in another.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. <span class='sc'>In</span> most debates, take up the favourable side of
the question; however, let me caution you against being
clamorous, that is, never maintain an argument
with heat, though you know yourself right; but offer
your sentiments modestly and coolly, and if this does
not prevail, give it up, and try to change the subject
by saying something to this effect—‘I find we shall
hardly convince one another, neither is there any
necessity to attempt it; so let us talk of something
else.’</p>

<p class='c006'>27. <span class='sc'>Not</span> that I would have you give up your opinion
always; no, assert your own sentiments, and oppose
those of others, when wrong; but let your manner
and voice be gentle and engaging, and yet no ways
affected. If you contradict, do it with, ‘I may be
wrong, I won’t be positive, but I really think—I
should rather suppose—If I may be permitted to say,’
and close your dispute with good humour, to shew that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>you are neither displeased yourself nor meant to displease
the person you dispute with.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. <span class='sc'>Acquaint</span> yourself with the character and
situations of the company you go into, before you give
a loose to your tongue; for, should you enlarge on
some virtue, which any one present may notoriously
want; or should you condemn some vice, which any
of the company may be particularly addicted to, they
will be apt to think your reflections pointed and personal,
and you will be sure to give offence. This consideration
will naturally lead you, not to suppose things
said in general, to be leveled at you.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. <span class='sc'>Low-bred</span> people, when they happen occasionally
to be in good company, imagine themselves to
be the subject of every separate conversation. If any
part of the company whisper, it is about them; if
they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing is said
which they do not comprehend, they immediately
suppose it is meant of them. This mistake is admirably
ridiculed in one of our celebrated comedies, ‘I
am sure,’ says Scrub, ‘they were talking of me, for they
laughed consumedly.’ Now, a well-bred person never
thinks himself disesteemed by the company, or
laughed at, unless their reflections are so gross, that
he cannot be supposed to mistake them, and his honour
obliges him to resent it in a proper manner; however,
be assured, gentlemen never laugh at, or ridicule
one another, unless they are in joke, or on a footing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of the greatest intimacy. If such a thing should happen
once in an age, from some pert coxcomb, or some
flippant woman, it is better to seem not to know it,
than to make the least reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. <span class='sc'>It</span> is a piece of politeness not to interrupt a
person in a story, whether you have heard it before
or not. Nay, if a well-bred man is asked whether he
has heard it; he will answer no, and let the person
go on, though he knows it already. Some are fond
of telling a story, because they think they tell it well,
others pride themselves in being the first teller of it,
and others are pleased at being thought entrusted with
it. Now, all these persons you would disappoint by
answering yes. And, as I have told you before, as
the greatest proof of politeness is to make every body
happy about you, I would never deprive a person of
any secret satisfaction of this sort, in which I could
gratify him by a minute’s attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. <span class='sc'>Be</span> not ashamed of asking questions, if such
questions lead to information; always accompany them
with some excuse, and you never will be reckoned impertinent.
But abrupt questions, without some apology,
by all means avoid, as they imply design. There
is a way of fishing for facts, which, if done judiciously,
will answer every purpose, such as, taking things
you wish to know for granted; this will perhaps lead
some officious person to set you right. So again, by
saying, you have heard so and so, and sometimes seeming
to know more than you do, you will often get at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>information, which you would lose by direct questions,
as these would put people on their guard, and
frequently defeat the very end you aim at.</p>

<p class='c006'>32. <span class='sc'>Make</span> it a rule never to reflect on any body
of people, for, reflections of this nature create many
enemies. There are good and bad of all professions;
lawyers, soldiers, parsons, or citizens. They
are all men, subject to the same passions, differing only
in their manner, according to the way they have been
bred up in. For this reason, it is unjust, as well as
indiscreet, to attack them as a <span class='fss'>CORPS</span> collectively.
Many a young man has thought himself extremely
clever in abusing the clergy. What are the clergy
more than other men? Can you suppose a black gown
can make any alteration in his nature? Fie, fie; think
seriously, and I am convinced you will never do it.</p>

<p class='c006'>33. <span class='sc'>But</span> above all, let no example, no fashion, no
witticism, no foolish desire of rising above what knaves
call prejudices, tempt you to excuse, extenuate or ridicule
the least breach of morality; but upon every
occasion, shew the greatest abhorrence of such proceedings,
and hold virtue and religion in the highest veneration.</p>

<p class='c006'>34. <span class='sc'>It</span> is a great piece of ill-manners to interrupt
any one while speaking, by speaking yourself, or calling
off the attention of the company to any foreign
matter. But this every child knows.</p>

<p class='c006'>35. <span class='sc'>The</span> last thing I shall mention is that of concealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>your learning, except on particular occasions.
Reserve this for learned men, and let them rather
extort it from you, than you be too willing to display
it. Hence you will be thought modest, and to have
more knowledge than you really have. Never seem
wise or more learned than the company you are in.
He who affects to shew his learning, will be frequently
questioned; and if found superficial, will be sneered
at; if otherwise, he will be deemed a pedant. Real
merit will always shew itself, and nothing can lessen
it in the opinion of the world, but a man’s exhibiting
it himself.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>For</span> God’s sake, revolve all these things seriously
in your mind, before you go abroad into life. Recollect
the observations you have yourself occasionally
made upon men and things, compare them with my
instructions, and act wisely, and consequently, as
they shall teach you.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='small'>MY DEAR GIRLS</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> had the misfortune to be deprived of your
mother, at a time of life when you were insensible
of your loss, and could receive little benefit, either
from her instruction, or her example. Before this
comes to your hands, you will likewise have lost your
father.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> had many melancholy reflections on the forlorn
and helpless situation you must be in, if it should
please God to remove me from you before you arrive
at that period of life, when you will be able to think
and act for yourselves. I know mankind too well.
I know their falsehood, their dissipation, their coldness
to all the duties of friendship and humanity. I know
the little attention paid to helpless infancy. You will
meet with few friends disinterested enough to do you
good offices, when you are incapable of making them
any return, by contributing to their interest or their
pleasure, or to the gratification of their vanity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><span class='sc'>I have</span> been supported under the gloom naturally
arising from these reflections, by a reliance on the
goodness of that Providence which has hitherto preferred
you, and given me the most pleasing prospect
of the goodness of your dispositions; and by the secret
hope, that your mother’s virtues will entail a
blessing on her children.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> anxiety I have for your happiness has made me
resolve to throw together my sentiments, relating to
your future conduct in life. If I live for some years,
you will receive them with much greater advantage,
suited to your different geniuses and dispositions. If
I die sooner, you must receive them in this very imperfect
manner,—the last proof of my affection.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> will all remember your father’s fondness, when
perhaps every other circumstance relating to him is
forgotten. This remembrance, I hope, will induce
you to give a serious attention to the advices I am
now going to leave with you.—I can request this
attention with the greater confidence, as my sentiments
on the most interesting points that regard life
and manners, were entirely correspondent to your
mother’s, whose judgment and taste I trusted much
more than my own.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> must expect that the advice which I shall
give you will be very imperfect, as there are many
nameless delicacies, in female manners, of which none
but a woman can judge.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><span class='sc'>You</span> will have one advantage by attending to what
I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at least
for once in your lives, the genuine sentiments of a
man, who has no interest in flattering or deceiving
you.—I shall throw my reflections together without
any studied order, and shall only, to avoid confusion
range them under a few general heads.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> will see, in a little treatise of mine just published,
in what an honourable point of view I have
considered your sex; not as domestic drudges, or the
slaves of our pleasures, but as our companions and
equals; as designed to soften our hearts and polish
our manners; and as Thomson finely says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>To raise the virtues, animate the bliss,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And sweeten all the toils of human life.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I shall not repeat what I have there said on this subject,
and shall only observe, that from the view I
have given of your natural character and place in society,
there arises a certain propriety of conduct peculiar
to your sex. It is this peculiar propriety of
female manners of which I intend to give you my
sentiments, without touching on those general rules of
conduct by which men and women are equally bound.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>While</span> I explain to you that system of conduct
which I think will tend most to your honour and happiness,
I shall, at the same time, endeavour to point
out those virtues and accomplishment which render
you most respectable and most amiable in the eyes of
my own sex.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>RELIGION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Though</span> the duties of religion, strictly speaking,
are equally binding on both sexes, yet certain
differences in their natural character and education,
render some vices in your sex particularly odious.
The natural hardiness of our hearts, and strength of
our passions, inflamed by the uncontrouled license we
are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to
render our manners more dissolute, and make us less
susceptible of the finer feelings of the heart. Your
superior delicacy, your modesty, and the usual severity
of your education, preserve you, in a great measure,
from any temptation to those vices to which we are
most subjected. The natural softness and sensibility of
your dispositions particularly fit you for the practice of
those duties where the heart is chiefly concerned. And
this, along with the natural warmth of your imaginations,
renders you peculiarly susceptible of the feelings
of devotion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> are many circumstances in your situation
that peculiarly require the supports of religion to enable
you to act in them with spirit and propriety.
Your whole life is often a life of suffering. You
cannot plunge into business, or dissipate yourselves
in pleasure and riot, as men too often do, when under
the pressure of misfortunes. You must bear your sorrows
in silence, unknown and unpitied. You must
often put on a face of serenity and cheerfulness, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>your hearts are torn with anguish, or sinking in despair.
Then your only resource is in the consolations
of religion. It is chiefly owing to these that you bear
domestic misfortunes better than we do.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> you are sometimes in very different circumstances,
that equally require the restraints of religion.
The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity
of your sex, are very apt to lead you into a dissipated
state of life, that deceives you, under the appearance
of innocent pleasure; but which in reality wastes
your spirits, impairs your health, weakens all the superior
faculties of your minds, and often sullies your
reputations. Religion by checking this dissipation
and rage for pleasure, enables you to draw more happiness,
even from those very sources of amusement,
which when too frequently applied to, are often productive
of satiety and disgust.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Religion</span> is rather a matter of sentiment than
reasoning. The important and interesting articles
of faith are sufficiently plain. Fix your attention on
these, and do not meddle with controversy. If you
get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which
you will never be able to extricate yourselves. It
spoils the temper, and, I suspect, has no good effect
on the heart.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Avoid</span> all books, and all conversation, that tend
to shake your faith on those great points of religion
which should serve to regulate your conduct, and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>which your hopes of future and eternal happiness
depend.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Never</span> indulge yourselves in ridicule on religious
subjects; nor give countenance to it in others, by
seeming diverted with what they say. This, to
people of good-breeding, will be a sufficient check.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I wish</span> you to go no farther than the Scriptures
for your religious opinions. Embrace those you find
clearly revealed. Never perplex yourselves about
such as you do not understand, but treat them with
silent and becoming reverence.—I would advise you
to read only such religious books as are addressed to
the heart; such as inspire pious and devout affections,
such as are proper to direct you in your conduct, and
not such as tend to entangle you in the endless maze
of opinions and systems.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Be</span> punctual in the stated performance of your private
devotions morning and evening. If you have
any sensibility or imagination, this will establish such
an intercourse between you and the Supreme Being, as
will be of infinite consequence to you in life. It will
communicate an habitual cheerfulness to your tempers;
give a firmness and steadiness to your virtue,
and enable you to go through all the vicissitudes of
human life with propriety and dignity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I wish</span> you to be regular in your attendance on
public worship, and in receiving the communion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Allow nothing to interrupt your public or private devotions,
except the performance of some active duty in
life, to which they should always give place.—In your
behaviour at public worship, observe an exemplary
attention and gravity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>That</span> extreme strictness which I recommend to
you in these duties, will be considered by many of
your acquaintance as a superstitious attachment to
forms; but in the advice I give you on this and
other subjects, I have an eye to the spirit and manners
of the age. There is a levity and dissipation in the
present manners, a coldness and listlessness in whatever
relates to religion, which cannot fail to infect you,
unless you purposely cultivate in your minds a contrary
bias, and make the devotional taste habitual.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Avoid</span> all grimace and ostentation in your religious
duties. They are the usual cloaks of hypocrisy;
at least they shew a weak and vain mind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Do</span> not make religion a subject of common conversation
in mixed companies. When it is introduced,
rather seem to decline it. At the same time, never
suffer any person to insult you by any foolish ribaldry
on your religious opinions, but shew the same resentment
you would naturally do on being offered any
other personal insult. But the surest way to avoid
this, is by a modest reserve on the subject, and by using
no freedom with others about their religious sentiments.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span><span class='sc'>Cultivate</span> an enlarged charity for all mankind,
however they may differ from you in their religious
opinions. That difference may probably arise from
causes in which you had no share, and from which
you can derive no merit.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Shew</span> your regard to religion, by a distinguishing
respect to all its ministers, of whatever persuasion, who
do not by their lives dishonour their profession; but
never allow them the direction of your consciences lest
they taint you with the narrow spirit of their party.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> best effect of your religion will be a diffusive
humanity to all in distress.—Set apart a certain proportion
of your income as sacred to charitable purposes.
But in this, as well as in the practice of every
other duty, carefully avoid ostentation. Vanity is always
defeating her own purposes. Fame is one of the
natural rewards of virtue. Do not pursue her, and
she will follow you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Do</span> not confine your charity to giving money. You
may have many opportunities of shewing a tender and
compassionate spirit where your money is not wanted.—There
is a false and unnatural refinement in sensibility,
which makes some people shun the sight of every
object in distress. Never indulge this, especially
where your friends or acquaintances are concerned.
Let the days of their misfortunes, when the world forgets
or avoids them, be the season for you to exercise
your humanity and friendship. The sight of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>misery softens the heart, and makes it better; it
checks the pride of health and prosperity, and the distress
it occasions is amply compensated by the consciousness
of doing your duty, and by the secret endearments
which nature has annexed to all our sympathetic
sorrows.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Women</span> are greatly deceived, when they think they
recommend themselves to our sex by their indifference
about religion. Even those men who are themselves
unbelievers dislike infidelity in you. Every man
who knows human nature, connects a religious taste
in your sex with softness and sensibility of heart; at
least we always consider the want of it as a proof of
that hard and masculine spirit, which of all your
faults we dislike the most. Besides, men consider your
religion as one of their principal securities for that
female virtue in which they are most interested. If a
gentleman pretends an attachment to any of you, and
endeavours to shake your religious principles, be assured
he is either a fool, or has designs on you which
he dares not openly avow.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> will probably wonder at my having educated
you in a church different from my own. The reason
was plainly this: I looked on the differences between
our churches to be of no real importance, and that a
preference of one to the other was a mere matter of
taste. Your mother was educated in the church of
England, and had an attachment to it, and I had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>prejudice in favour of every thing she liked. It never
was her desire that you should be baptized by a clergyman
of the church of England, or be educated in that
church. On the contrary, the delicacy of her regard
to the smallest circumstance that could affect me in the
eye of the world, made her anxiously insist it might be
otherwise. But I could not yield to her in that kind
of generality.—When I lost her, I became still more
determined to educate you in that church, as I feel a
secret pleasure in doing every thing that appears to me
to express my affection and veneration for her memory.—I
draw but a very faint and imperfect picture of
what your mother was, while I endeavour to point
out what you should be.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reader will remember, that such observations
as respect equally both the sexes are all along as much
as possible avoided.</p>
</div>
<h3 class='c008'>CONDUCT <span class='small'>AND</span> BEHAVIOUR.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>One</span> of the chiefest beauties in a female character
is that modest reserve, that retiring delicacy,
which avoids the public eye, and is disconcerted even
at the gaze of admiration.—I do not wish you to be
insensible to applause. If you were, you must become,
if not worse, at least less amiable women. But you
may be dazzled by that admiration, which yet rejoices
your hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><span class='sc'>When</span> a girl ceases to blush, she has lost the most
powerful charm of beauty. That extreme sensibility
which it indicates, may be a weakness and incumbrance
in our sex, as I have too often felt; but in
yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pedants, who think
themselves philosophers, ask why a woman should blush
when she is conscious of no crime. It is a sufficient
answer, that Nature has made you to blush when you
are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you
because you do so.—Blushing is so far from being necessarily
an attendant on guilt, that it is the usual
companion of innocence.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> modesty, which I think so essential in your
sex, will naturally dispose you to be rather silent in
company, especially in a large one.—People of sense
and discernment will never mistake such silence for
dulness. One may take a share in conversation without
uttering a syllable. The expression in the countenance
shews it, and this never escapes an observing
eye.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I should</span> be glad that you had an easy dignity in
your behaviour at public places, but not that confident
ease, that unabashed countenance, which seems to set
the company at defiance.—If, while a gentleman is
speaking to you, one of superior rank addresses you,
do not let your eager attention and visible preference
betray the flutter of your heart. Let your pride on
this occasion preserve you from that meanness into
which your vanity would sink you. Consider that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>you expose yourselves to the ridicule of the company,
and affront one gentleman only to swell the triumph of
another, who perhaps thinks he does you honour in
speaking to you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Converse</span> with men even of the first rank with
that dignified modesty, which may prevent the approach
of the most distant familiarity, and consequently
prevent them from feeling themselves your superiors.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Wit</span> is the most dangerous talent you can possess.
It must be guarded with great discretion and good-nature,
otherwise it will create you many enemies.
It is perfectly consistent with softness and delicacy;
yet they are seldom found united. Wit is so flattering
to vanity, that those who possess it become intoxicated,
and lose all self-command.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Humour</span> is a different quality. It will make your
company much solicited; but be cautious how you
indulge it.—It is often a great enemy to delicacy,
and a still greater one to dignity of character. It
may sometimes gain you applause, but will never procure
you respect.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Be</span> even cautious in displaying your good sense.
It will be thought you assume a superiority over the
rest of the company. But if you happen to have any
learning, keep it a profound secret, especially from
the men, who generally look with a jealous and malignant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>eye on a woman of great parts, and a cultivated
understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A man</span> of real genius and candour is far superior
to this meanness. But such a one will seldom fall in
your way; and if by accident he should, do not be
anxious to shew the full extent of your knowledge. If
he has any opportunities of seeing you, he will soon
discover it himself; and if you have any advantages
of person or manner, and keep your own secret, he
will probably give you credit for a great deal more
than you possess.—The great art of pleasing in conversation
consists in making the company pleased with
themselves. You will more readily hear than talk
yourselves into their good graces.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Beware</span> of detraction, especially where your own
sex are concerned. You are generally accused of
being particularly addicted to this vice; I think unjustly.—Men
are fully as guilty of it when their interests
interfere. As your interests more frequently
clash, and as your feelings are quicker than ours, your
temptations to it are more frequent. For this reason,
be particularly tender of the reputation of your own
sex, especially when they happen to rival you in our
regards. We look on this as the strongest proof of
dignity and true greatness of mind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Shew</span> a compassionate sympathy to unfortunate women,
especially to those who are rendered so by the
villany of men. Indulge a secret pleasure, I may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>say pride, in being the friends and refuge of the unhappy,
but without the vanity of shewing it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Consider</span> every species of indelicacy in conversation,
as shameful in itself, and as highly disgusting to us.
All double entendre is of this sort.—The dissoluteness
of men’s education allows them to be diverted with
a kind of wit, which yet they have delicacy enough
to be shocked at, when it comes from your mouths,
or even when you hear it without pain and contempt.
Virgin purity is of that delicate nature, that it cannot
hear certain things without contamination. It is always
in your power to avoid these. No man, but
a brute or a fool, will insult a woman with conversation
which he sees gives her pain; nor will he dare
to do it, if she resent the injury with a becoming
spirit.—There is a dignity in conscious virtue which is
able to awe the most shameless and abandoned of men.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> will be reproached perhaps with prudery. By
prudery is usually meant an affectation of delicacy.
Now I do not wish you to affect delicacy; I wish you to
possess it. At any rate, it is better to run the risk of
being thought ridiculous than disgusting.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> men will complain of your reserve. They
will assure you, that a franker behaviour would make
you more amiable. But trust me, they are not sincere
when they tell you so.—I acknowledge, that on some
occasions it might render you more agreeable as companions,
but it would make you less amiable as women;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>an important distinction which many of your sex
are not aware of.—After all, I wish you to have great
ease and openness in your conversation. I only point
out some considerations which ought to regulate your
behaviour in that respect.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Have</span> a sacred regard to truth. Lying is a mean
and despicable vice.—I have known some women of
excellent parts, who were so much addicted to it, that
they could not be trusted in the relation of any story,
especially if it contained any thing of the marvellous,
or if they themselves were the heroines of the tale.
This weakness did not proceed from a bad heart, but
was merely the effect of vanity, or an unbridled imagination.—I
do not mean to censure that lively embellishment
of a humorous story, which is only intended
to promote innocent mirth.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a certain gentleness of spirit and manners
extremely engaging in your sex; not that indiscriminate
attention, that unmeaning simper, which smiles
on all alike. This arises, either from an affectation
of softness, or from perfect insipidity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a species of refinement in luxury, just
beginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this
country, to which our ladies are yet as great strangers
as any women upon earth; I hope, for the honour of
the sex, they may ever continue so: I mean, the
luxury of eating. It is a despicable selfish vice in
men, but in your sex it is beyond expression indelicate
and disgusting.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span><span class='sc'>Every</span> one who remembers a few years back, is
sensible of a very striking change in the attention and
respect formerly paid by the gentlemen to the ladies.
Their drawing-rooms are deserted; and after dinner
and supper, the gentlemen are impatient till they retire.
How they came to lose this respect, which nature
and politeness so well intitle them to, I shall not
here particularly inquire. The revolutions of manners
in any country depend on causes very various
and complicated. I shall only observe, that the behaviour
of the ladies in the last age was very reserved
and stately. It would now be reckoned ridiculously
stiff and formal. Whatever it was, it had certainly
the effect of making them more respected.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A fine</span> woman, like other fine things in nature,
has her proper point of view, from which she may be
seen to most advantage. To fix this point requires
great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the
human heart. By the present mode of female manners,
the ladies seem to expect that they shall regain
their ascendancy over us, by the fullest display of their
personal charms, by being always in our eye at public
places, by conversing with us with the same unreserved
freedom as we do with one another; in short, by resembling
us as nearly as they possibly can.—But a
little time and experience will shew the folly of this
expectation and conduct.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> power of a fine woman over the hearts of men,
men of the finest parts, is even beyond what she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>conceives. They are sensible of the pleasing illusion,
but they cannot, nor do they wish to dissolve it. But
if she is determined to dispel the charm, it certainly
is in her power: she may soon reduce the angel to
a very ordinary girl.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a native dignity, an ingenuous modesty
to be expected in your sex, which is your natural protection
from the familiarities of the men, and which
you should feel previous to the reflection that it is
your interest to keep yourselves sacred from all personal
freedoms. The many nameless charms and
endearments of beauty should be reserved to bless the
arms of the happy man to whom you give your heart,
but who, if he has the least delicacy, will despise them,
if he knows that they have been prostituted to fifty
men before him.—The sentiment, that a woman may
allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is
secure, is both grossly indelicate and dangerous, and
has proved fatal to many of your sex.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Let</span> me now recommend to your attention that
elegance, which is not so much a quality itself, as
the high polish of every other. It is what diffuses an
ineffable grace over every look, every motion, every
sentence you utter. It gives that charm to beauty
without which it generally fails to please. It is partly
a personal quality, in which respect it is the gift of
nature; but I speak of it principally as a quality of
the mind. In a word, it is the perfection of taste in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>life and manners;—every virtue and every excellence,
in their most graceful and amiable forms.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> may perhaps think that I want to throw every
spark of nature out of your composition, and to make
you entirely artificial. Far from it. I wish you to
possess the most perfect simplicity of heart and manners.
I think you may possess dignity without pride,
affability without meanness, and simple elegance
without affectation. Milton had my idea, when he
says of Eve,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, In every
gesture dignity and love.</i></p>
<h3 class='c008'>AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Every</span> period of life has amusements which
are natural and proper to it. You may indulge
the variety of your tastes in these, while you keep
within the bounds of that propriety which is suitable
to your sex.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Some</span> amusements are conducive to health, as various
kinds of exercise: some are connected with
qualities really useful, as different kinds of women’s
work, and all the domestic concerns of a family: some
are elegant accomplishments, as dress, dancing, music,
and drawing. Such books as improve your understanding,
enlarge your knowledge, and cultivate your
taste, may be considered in a higher point of view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>than mere amusements. There are a variety of others,
which are neither useful nor ornamental, such as play
of different kinds.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I would</span> particularly recommend to you those exercises
that oblige you to be much abroad in the open
air, such as walking, and riding on horse back. This
will give vigour to your constitutions, and a bloom to
your complexions. If you accustom yourselves to go
abroad always in chairs and carriages, you will soon
become so enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors
without them. They are like most articles of luxury,
useful and agreeable when judiciously used; but when
made habitual, they become both insipid and pernicious.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>An</span> attention to your health is a duty you owe to
yourselves and to your friends. Bad health seldom
fails to have an influence on the spirits and temper.
The finest geniuses, the most delicate minds, have
very frequently a correspondent delicacy of bodily
constitutions, which they are too apt to neglect.
Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal
enemies to health and beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> though good health be one of the greatest
blessings of life, never make a boast of it, but enjoy it
in grateful silence. We so naturally associate the idea
of female softness and delicacy with a correspondent
delicacy of constitution, that when a woman speaks of
her great strength, her extraordinary appetite, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>ability to bear excessive fatigue, we recoil at the description
in a way she is little aware of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> intention of your being taught needlework,
knitting, and such like, is not on account of the intrinsic
value of all you can do with your hands, which
is trifling, but to enable you to judge more perfectly
of that kind of work, and to direct the execution of it
in others. Another principal end is to enable you to
fill up, in a tolerably agreeable way, some of the many
solitary hours you must necessarily pass at home. It
is a great article in the happiness of life, to have your
pleasures as independent of others as possible. By
continually gadding abroad in search of amusement,
you lose the respect of all your acquaintances, whom
you oppress with those visits, which, by a more discreet
management, might have been courted.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> domestic economy of a family is entirely a
woman’s province, and furnishes a variety of subjects
for the exertion both of good sense and good taste. If
you ever come to have the charge of a family, it ought
to engage much of your time and attention; nor can
you be excused from this by any extent of fortune,
though with a narrow one the ruin that follows the
neglect of it may be more immediate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I am</span> at the greatest loss what to advise you in regard
to books. There is no impropriety in your
reading history, or cultivating any art or science to
which genius or accident leads you. The whole volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of Nature lies open to your eye, and furnishes
an infinite variety of entertainment. If I was sure
that nature had given you such strong principles of
taste and sentiment as would remain with you, and
influence your future conduct, with the utmost pleasure
would I endeavour to direct your reading in such
a way as might form that taste to the utmost perfection
of truth and elegance. “But when I reflect how easy
it is to warm a girl’s imagination, and how difficult
deeply and permanently to affect her heart; how readily
she enters into every refinement of sentiment, and
how easily she can sacrifice them to vanity or convenience;”
I think I may very probably do you an injury by
artificially creating a taste, which, if Nature never gave
it you, would only serve to embarrass your future
conduct.—I do not want to <i>make</i> you any thing: I want
to know what Nature has made you, and to perfect
you on her plan. I do not wish you to have sentiments
that might perplex you: I wish you to have sentiments
that may uniformly and steadily guide you, and
such as your hearts so thoroughly approve, that you
would not forego them for any consideration this world
could offer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dress</span> is an important article in female life. The
love of dress is natural to you, and therefore it is proper
and reasonable. Good sense will regulate your
expence in it, and good taste will direct you to dress
in such a way as to conceal any blemishes, and set off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>your beauties, if you have any, to the greatest advantage.
But much delicacy and judgement are required in the
application of this rule. A fine woman shews her
charms to most advantage, when she seems most to
conceal them. The finest bosom in nature is not so
fine as what imagination forms. The most perfect
elegance of dress appears always the most easy, and
the least studied.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Do</span> not confine your attention to dress to your public
appearances. Accustom yourselves to an habitual
neatness, so that in the most careless undress, in your
unguarded hours, you may have no reason to be ashamed
of your appearance.—You will not easily believe
how much we consider your dress as expressive of your
characters. Vanity, levity, slovenliness, folly, appear
through it. An elegant simplicity is an equal
proof of taste and delicacy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> dancing, the principal points you are to attend
to are ease and grace. I would have you to dance
with spirit; but never allow yourselves to be so far
transported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of
your sex.—Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and
innocence of her heart, is thought to discover a spirit
she little dreams of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I know</span> no entertainment that gives such pleasure
to any person of sentiment or humour, as the theatre.
But I am sorry to say, there are few English comedies
a lady can see, without a shock to delicacy. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>not readily suspect the comments gentlemen make on
your behaviour on such occasions. Men are often best
acquainted with the most worthless of your sex, and
from them too readily form their judgment of the rest.
A virtuous girl often hears very indelicate things with
a countenance no wise embarrassed, because in truth
she does not understand them. Yet this is, most ungenerously,
ascribed to that command of features, and
that ready presence of mind, which you are thought
to possess in a degree far beyond us; or, by still more
malignant observers, it is ascribed to hardened effrontery.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Sometimes</span> a girl laughs with all the simplicity of
unsuspecting innocence, for no other reason but being
infected with other people’s laughing: she is then
believed to know more than she should do.—If she
does happen to understand an improper thing, she
suffers a very complicated distress: she feels her modesty
hurt in the most sensible manner, and at the same
time is ashamed of appearing conscious of the injury.
The only way to avoid these inconveniencies, is never
to go to a play that is particularly offensive to delicacy.—Tragedy
subjects you to no such distress.—Its
sorrows will soften and ennoble your hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I need</span> say little about gaming, the ladies in this
country being as yet almost strangers to it. It is a
ruinous and incurable vice; and as it leads to all the
selfish and turbulent passions, is peculiarly odious in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>your sex. I have no objection to your playing a little
at any kind of game, as a variety in your amusements,
provided that what you can possibly lose is such a trifle
as can neither interest nor hurt you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> this, as well as in all important points of conduct,
shew a determined resolution and steadiness.
This is not in the least inconsistent with that softness
and gentleness so amiable in your sex. On the contrary,
it gives that spirit to a mild and sweet disposition,
without which it is apt to degenerate into insipidity.
It makes you respectable in your own eyes,
and dignifies you in ours.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> luxury and dissipation that prevail in genteel
life, as they corrupt the heart in many respects,
so they render it incapable of warm, sincere,
and steady friendship. A happy choice of friends will
be of the utmost consequence to you, as they may assist
you by their advice and good offices. But the immediate
gratification which friendship affords to a warm,
open and ingenuous heart, is of itself a sufficient motive
to court it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> the choice of your friends, have principal
regard to goodness of heart and fidelity. If they
also possess taste and genius, that will still make them
more agreeable and useful companions. You have
particular reason to place confidence in those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>have shewn affection for you in your early days, when
you were incapable of making them any return.
This is an obligation for which you cannot be too
grateful: When you read this, you will naturally
think of your mother’s friend, to whom you owe so
much.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you have the good fortune to meet with any who
deserve the name of friends, unbosom yourself to
them with the most unsuspicious confidence. It is
one of the world’s maxims, never to trust any person
with a secret, the discovery of which could give you
any pain; but it is the maxim of a little mind and
a cold heart, unless where it is the effect of frequent
disappointments and bad usage. An open temper, if
restrained but by tolerable prudence, will make you,
on the whole, much happier than a reserved suspicious
one, although you may sometimes suffer by it. Coldness
and distrust are but the too certain consequences
of age and experience; but they are unpleasant feelings,
and need not be anticipated before their time.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> however open you may be in talking of your
own affairs, never disclose the secrets of one friend to
another. These are sacred deposites, which do not
belong to you, nor have you any right to make use
of them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is another case, in which I suspect it is
proper to be secret, not so much from motives of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>prudence, as delicacy. I mean in love matters.
Though a woman has no reason to be ashamed of an
attachment to a man of merit, yet nature, whose
authority is superior to philosophy, has annexed a
sense of shame to it. It is even long before a woman
of delicacy dares avow to her own heart that she
loves; and when all the subterfuges of ingenuity to
conceal it from herself fail, she feels a violence done
both to her pride and to her modesty. This, I should
imagine, must always be the case where she is not sure
of a return to her attachment.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> such a situation, to lay the heart open to any
person whatever, does not appear to me consistent
with the perfection of female delicacy. But perhaps
I am in the wrong.—At the same time I must tell
you, that, in point of prudence, it concerns you to
attend well to the consequences of such a discovery.
These secrets, however important in your own estimation,
may appear very trifling to your friend, who
possibly will not enter into your feelings, but may
rather consider them as a subject of pleasantry. For
this reason, love-secrets are of all others the worst
kept. But the consequences to you may be very
serious, as no man of spirit and delicacy ever valued
a heart much hackneyed in the ways of love.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span>, therefore, you must have a friend to pour out
your heart to, be sure of her honour and secrecy.
Let her not be a married woman, especially if she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>lives happily with her husband, There are certain
unguarded moments, in which such a woman, though
the best and worthiest of her sex, may let hints escape,
which at other times, or to any other person than her
husband, she would be incapable of; nor will a husband
in this case feel himself under the same obligation
of secrecy and honour, as if you had put your
confidence originally in himself, especially on a subject
which the world is apt to treat so lightly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> all other circumstances are equal, there are obvious
advantages in your making friends of one another.
The ties of blood, and your being so much
united in one common interest, form an additional
bond of union to your friendship. If your brothers
should have the good fortune to have hearts susceptible
of friendship, to possess truth, honour, sense, and
delicacy of sentiment, they are the fittest and most
unexceptionable confidants. By placing confidence
in them, you will receive every advantage which you
could hope for from the friendship of men, without
any of the inconveniencies that attend such connexions
with our sex.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Beware</span> of making confidants of your servants.
Dignity not properly understood very readily degenerates
into pride, which enters into no friendships,
because it cannot bear an equal, and is so fond of
flattery as to grasp at it even from servants and dependants.
The most intimate confidants, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of proud people are valets-de-chamber and waiting
women. Shew the utmost humanity to your servants;
make their situation as comfortable to them
as is possible: but if you make them your confidants,
you spoil them, and debase yourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Never</span> allow any person, under the pretended
sanction of friendship, to be so familiar as to lose a
proper respect for you. Never allow them to tease
you on any subject that is disagreeable, or where you
have once taken your resolution. Many will tell
you, that this reserve is inconsistent with the freedom
which friendship allows. But a certain respect is as
necessary in friendship as in love. Without it, you
may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved
as an equal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> temper and dispositions of the heart in your
sex make you enter more readily and warmly into
friendships than men. Your natural propensity to
it is so strong, that you often run into intimacies
which you soon have sufficient cause to repent of;
and this makes your friendships so very fluctuating.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Another</span> great obstacle to the sincerity as well
as steadiness of your friendships is the great clashing
of your interests in the pursuits of love, ambition,
or vanity. For these reasons, it should appear at
first view more eligible for you to contract your
friendships with the men. Among other obvious
advantages of an easy intercourse between the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>sexes, it occasions an emulation and exertion in each
to excel and be agreeable: hence their respective excellencies
are mutually communicated and blended.—As
their interests in no degree interfere, there can be
no foundation for jealousy or suspicion of rivalship.
The friendship of a man for a woman is always blended
with a tenderness, which he never feels for one of his
own sex, even where love is in no degree concerned.
Besides we are conscious of a natural title you have to
our protection and good offices, and therefore we feel
an additional obligation of honour to serve you, and
to observe an inviolable secrecy, whenever you confide
in us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> apply these observations with great caution.
Thousands of women of the best hearts and finest parts
have been ruined by men who approached them under
the specious name of friendship. But supposing a
man to have the most undoubted honour, yet his
friendship to a woman is so near a-kin to love, that if
she be very agreeable in her person, she will probably
very soon find a lover, where she only wished to meet
a friend. Let me here, however, warn you against
that weakness so common among vain women, the
imagination that every man who takes particular notice
of you is a lover. Nothing can expose you more to
ridicule, than the taking up a man on the suspicion of
being your lover, who perhaps never once thought of
you in that view, and giving yourselves those airs so
common among silly women on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span class='sc'>There</span> is a kind of unmeaning gallantry much
practised by some men, which, if you have any discernment,
you will find really harmless. Men of this sort
will attend you to public places, and be useful to you
by a number of little observances, which those of a superior
class do not so well understand, or have not leisure
to regard, or perhaps are too proud to submit to.
Look on the compliments of such men as words of
course, which they repeat to every agreeable woman of
their acquaintance. There is a familiarity they are
apt to assume, which a proper dignity in your behaviour
will be easily able to check.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a different species of men whom you may
like as agreeable companions, men of worth, taste and
genius, whose conversation, in some respects, may be
superior to what you generally meet with among your
own sex. It will be foolish in you to deprive yourselves
of an useful and agreeable acquaintance, merely
because idle people say he is your lover. Such a man
may like your company, without having any design on
your person.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>People</span> whose sentiments, and particularly whose
tastes correspond, naturally like to associate together,
although neither of them have the most distant view
of any further connexion. But as this similarity of
minds often gives rise to a more tender attachment
than friendship, it will be prudent to keep a watchful
eye over yourselves, lest your hearts become too far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>engaged before you are aware of it. At the same
time, I do not think that your sex, at least in this part
of the world, have much of that sensibility which disposes
to such attachments. What is commonly called
love among you is rather gratitude, and a partiality to
the man who prefers you to the rest of your sex; and
such a man you often marry, with little of either personal
esteem or affection. Indeed, without an unusual
share of natural sensibility, and very peculiar good
fortune, a woman in this country has very little probability
of marrying for love.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> is a maxim laid down among you, and a very
prudent one it is. That love is not to begin on your
part, but is entirely to be the consequence of our attachment
to you. Now, supposing a woman to have
sense and taste, she will not find many men to whom
she can possibly be supposed to bear any considerable
share of esteem. Among these few, it is a very great
chance if any of them distinguishes her particularly.
Love, at least with us, is exceedingly capricious, and
will not always fix where reason says it should. But
supposing one of them should become particularly attached
to her, it is still extremely improbable that he
should be the man in the world her heart most approved
of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span>, therefore, Nature has not given you that unlimited
range in your choice which we enjoy, she has
wisely and benevolently assigned to you a greater flexibility
of taste on this subject. Some agreeable qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>recommend a gentleman to your common good
liking and friendship. In the course of his acquaintance,
he contracts an attachment to you. When you
perceive it, it excites your gratitude; this gratitude
rises into a preference, and this preference perhaps at
last advances to some degree of attachment, especially
if it meets with crosses and difficulties, for these, and
a state of suspense, are very great incitements to attachment,
and are the food of love in both sexes. If attachment
was not excited in your sex in this manner,
there is not one of a million of you that could ever
marry with any degree of love.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A man</span> of taste and delicacy marries a woman because
he loves her more than any other. A woman of
equal taste and delicacy marries him because she
esteems him, and because he gives her that preference.
But if a man unfortunately becomes attached to a woman
whose heart is secretly pre-engaged, his attachment,
instead of obtaining a suitable return, is particularly
offensive; and if he persists to teaze her, he
makes himself equally the object of her scorn and
aversion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> effects of love among men are diversified by
their different tempers. An artful man may counterfeit
every one of them so as easily to impose on a
young girl of an open, generous, and feeling heart, if
she is not extremely on her guard. The finest parts in
such a girl may not always prove sufficient for her security.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The dark and crooked paths of cunning are
unsearchable, and inconceivable to an honourable and
elevated mind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> following, I apprehend, are the most genuine
effects of an honourable passion among the men, and
the most difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy
often betrays his passion by his too great anxiety to
conceal it, especially if he has little hopes of success.
True love, in all its stages, seeks concealment, and
never expects success. It renders a man not only respectful,
but timid to the highest degree in his behaviour
to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe he
stands in of her, he may sometimes affect pleasantry,
but it sits aukwardly on him, and he quickly relapses
into seriousness, if not into dulness. He magnifies all
her real perfections in his imagination, and is either
blind to her failings, or converts them into beauties.
Like a person conscious of guilt, he is jealous that
every eye observes him; and to avoid this, he shuns
all the little observances of common gallantry.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>His</span> heart and his character will be improved in
every respect by his attachment.  His manners will
become more gentle, and his conversation more agreeable;
but diffidence and embarrassment will always
make him appear to disadvantage in the company of
his mistress. If the fascination continue long, it will
totally depress his spirit, and extinguish every active,
vigorous and manly principle of his mind. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>find this subject beautifully and pathetically painted
in Thomson’s Spring.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> you observe in a gentleman’s behaviour
these marks which I have described above, reflect seriously
what you are to do. If his attachment is
agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good
sense, and delicacy shall direct you. If you love him
let me advise you never to discover to him the full extent
of your love, no not although you marry him.
That sufficiently shews your preference, which is all
he is entitled to know. If he has delicacy, he will ask
for no stronger proof of your affection for your sake;
if he has sense, he will not ask it for his own. This
is an unpleasant truth, but it is my duty to let you
know it; violent love cannot subsist, at least cannot
be expressed, for any time together, on both sides;
otherwise the certain consequence, however concealed,
is satiety and disgust. Nature in this case has laid
the reserve on you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you see evident proofs of a gentleman’s attachment,
and are determined to shut your heart against
him, as you ever hope to be used with generosity by
the person who shall engage your own heart, treat him
honourably and humanely. Do not let him linger in
a miserable suspense, but be anxious to let him know
your sentiments with regard to him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>However</span> people’s hearts may deceive them, there
is scarcely a person that can love for any time without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>at least some distant hope of success. If you really
wish to undeceive a lover, you may do it in a variety
of ways. There is a certain species of easy familiarity
in your behaviour, which may satisfy him, if he has
any discernment left, that he has nothing to hope for.
But perhaps your particular temper may not admit of
this.—You may easily shew that you want to avoid
his company; but if he is a man whose friendship you
wish to preserve, you may not chuse this method, because
then you lose him in every capacity.—You may
get a common friend to explain matters to him, or
fall on many other devices, if you are seriously anxious
to put him out of suspense.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> if you are resolved against every such method,
at least do not shun opportunities of letting him explain
himself. If you do this, you act barbarously
and unjustly. If he brings you to an explanation,
give him a polite, but resolute and decisive answer.
In whatever way you convey your sentiments to him,
if he is a man of spirit and delicacy, he will give you
no further trouble, nor apply to your friends for their
intercession. This last is a method of courtship which
every man of spirit will disdain.—He will never whine
nor sue for your pity. That would mortify him almost
as much as your scorn. In short, you may possibly
break such a heart, but you cannot bend it.—Great
pride always accompanies delicacy, however
concealed under the appearance of the utmost gentleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and modesty, and is the passion of all others the
most difficult to conquer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a case where a woman may coquette
justifiably to the utmost verge which her conscience
will allow. It is where a gentleman purposely declines
to make his addresses, till such time as he thinks
himself perfectly sure of her consent. This at bottom
is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted
privilege of her sex, the privilege of her refusing;
it is intended to force her to explain herself, in effect,
before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this
mean to oblige her to violate the modesty and delicacy
of her sex, and to invert the clearest order of nature.
All this sacrifice is proposed to be made merely
to gratify a most despicable vanity in a man who
would degrade the very woman whom he wishes to
make his wife.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> is of great importance to distinguish, whether a
gentleman who has the appearance of being your lover
delays to speak explicitly, from the motive I have
mentioned, or from a diffidence inseparable from true
attachment. In the one case, you can scarcely use
him too ill: in the other, you ought to use him with
great kindness: and the greatest kindness you can
shew him, if you are determined not to listen to his
addresses, is to let him know it as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I know</span> the many excuses with which women endeavour
to justify themselves to the world, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>their own consciences, when they act otherwise.
Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at least uncertainty,
of the gentleman’s real sentiments. That may
sometimes be the case. Sometimes they plead the
decorums of their sex, which enjoin an equal behaviour
to all men, and forbid them to consider any man
as a lover, till he has directly told them so.—Perhaps
few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and
decorum so far as I do. But I must say, you are not
entitled to plead the obligation of these virtues, in
opposition to the superior ones of gratitude, justice,
and humanity. The man is entitled to all these, who
prefers you to the rest of your sex, and perhaps whose
greatest weakness is this very preference. The truth of
the matter is, vanity, and the love of admiration, are
so prevailing passions among you, that you may be
considered to make a very great sacrifice whenever you
give up a lover, till every art of coquetry fails to keep
him, or till he forces you to an explanation. You
can be fond of the love, when you are indifferent to,
or even when you despise the lover.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> the deepest and most artful coquetry is employed
by women of superior taste and sense, to engage
and fix the heart of a man whom the world and
whom they themselves esteem, although they are firmly
determined never to marry him. But his conversation
amuses them, and his attachment is the highest
gratification to their vanity; nay, they can sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame,
and happiness.—God forbid I should ever think so of
all your sex. I know many of them have principles,
have generosity and dignity of soul that elevates them
above the worthless vanity I have been speaking of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Such</span> a woman, I am persuaded, may always convert
a lover, if she cannot give him her affections, into
a warm and steady friend, provided he is a man of
sense, resolution, and candour. If she explains herself
to him with a generous openness and freedom, he
must feel the stroke as a man; but he will likewise
bear it as a man: what he suffers he will suffer in silence.
Every sentiment of esteem will remain; but
love though it requires very little food, and is easily
surfeited with too much, yet it requires some. He
will view her in the light of a married woman; and
though passion subsides, yet a man of a candid and
generous heart always retains a tenderness for a woman
he has once loved, and who has used him well,
beyond what he feels for any other of her sex.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> he has not confided his own secret to any body,
he has an undoubted title to ask you not to divulge it.
If a woman chuses to trust any of her companions
with her own unfortunate attachments, she may, as it
is her own affair alone: but if she has any generosity
or gratitude, she will not betray a secret which does
not belong to her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Male</span> coquetry is much more inexcusable than female,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>as well as more pernicious; but it is rare in this
country. Very few men will give themselves the trouble
to gain or retain any woman’s affections, unless they
have views on her either of an honourable or dishonourable
kind. Men employed in the pursuits of business,
ambition, or pleasure, will not give themselves
the trouble to engage a woman’s affections merely from
the vanity of conquest, and of triumphing over the
heart of an innocent and defenceless girl. Besides,
people never value much what is entirely in their power.
A man of parts, sentiment, and address, if he lays
aside all regard to truth and humanity, may engage the
hearts of fifty women at the same time, and may likewise
conduct his coquetry with so much art, as to put it
out of the power of any of them to specify a single expression
that could be said to be directly expressive of
love.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>This</span> ambiguity of behaviour, this art of keeping
one in suspense, is the great secret of coquetry in both
sexes. It is the more cruel in us, because we can carry
it what length we please, and continue it as long as we
please, without your being so much as at liberty to complain
or expostulate; whereas we can break our chain,
and force you to explain, whenever we become impatient
of our situation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> insisted the more particularly on this subject
of courtship, because it may most readily happen to you
at that early period of life when you can have little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>experience or knowledge of the world, when your
passions are warm, and your judgments not arrived at
such full maturity as to be able to correct them.—I
wish you to possess such high principles of honour and
generosity as will render you incapable of deceiving,
and at the same time to possess that acute discernment
which may secure you against being deceived.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A woman</span>, in this country, may easily prevent the
first impressions of love, and every motive of prudence
and delicacy should make her guard her heart against
them, till such time as she has received the most convincing
proof of the attachment of a man of such
merit, as will justify a reciprocal regard. Your hearts
indeed may be shut inflexibly and permanently against
all the merit a man can possess. That may be your
misfortune, but cannot be your fault. In such a situation,
you would be equally unjust to yourself and
your lover, if you gave him your hand when your
heart revolted against him. But miserable will be your
fate, if you allow an attachment to steal on you before
you are sure of a return; or, what is infinitely worse,
where there are wanting those qualities which alone
can ensure happiness in a married state.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I know</span> nothing that renders a woman more despicable,
than her thinking it essential to happiness to be
married. Besides the gross indelicacy of the sentiment,
it is a false one, as thousands of women have experienced.
But if it was true, the belief that it is so, and
the consequent impatience to be married, is the most
effectual way to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><span class='sc'>You</span> must not think from this, that I do not wish
you to marry. On the contrary, I am of opinion, that
you may attain a superior degree of happiness in a
married state, to what you can possibly find in any
other. I know the forlorn and unprotected situation
of an old maid, the chagrin and peevishness which are
apt to infect their tempers, and the great difficulty of
making a transition with dignity and chearfulness
from the period of youth, beauty, admiration, and
respect, into the calm, silent, unnoticed retreat of
declining years.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I see</span> some unmarried women of active, vigorous
minds, and great vivacity of spirits, degrading themselves;
sometimes by entering into a dissipated course
of life, unsuitable to their years, and exposing themselves
to the ridicule of girls, who might have been
their grand-children; sometimes by oppressing their
acquaintances by impertinent intrusions into their
private affairs; and sometimes by being the propagators
of scandal and defamation. All this is owing to
an exuberant activity of spirit, which if it had found
employment at home, would have rendered them respectable
and useful members of society.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I see</span> other women in the same situation, gentle,
modest, blessed with sense, taste, delicacy, and every
milder feminine virtue of the heart, but of weak
spirits, bashful and timid: I see such women sinking
into obscurity and insignificance, and gradually losing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>every elegant accomplishment; for this evident reason,
that they are not united to a partner who has
sense, and worth, and taste, to know their value; one
who is able to draw forth their concealed qualities,
and shew them to advantage; who can give that support
to their feeble spirits which they stand so much
in need of; and who, by his affection and tenderness,
might make such a woman happy in exerting every
talent, and accomplishing herself in every elegant art
that could contribute to his amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>In</span> short, I am of opinion, that a married state, if
entered into from proper motives of esteem and affection,
will be the happiest for yourselves, and make
you most respectable in the eyes of the world, and
the most useful members of society. But I confess I
am not enough of a patriot to wish you to marry for
the good of the public. I wish you to marry for no
other reason but to make yourselves happier. When
I am so particular in my advices about your conduct,
I own my heart beats with the fond hope of making
you worthy the attachment of men who will deserve
you, and be sensible of your merit. But heaven forbid
you should ever relinquish the ease and independence
of a single life, to become the slaves of a fool, or a
tyrant’s caprice.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> these have been always my sentiments, I shall
do you but justice, when I leave you in such independent
circumstances as may lay you under no temptation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to do from necessity what you would never do
from choice.—This will likewise save you from that
cruel mortification to a woman of spirit, the suspicion
that a gentleman thinks he does you an honour or a
favour when he asks you for his wife.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> I live till you arrive at that age when you shall
be capable to judge for yourselves, and do not strangely
alter my sentiments, I shall act towards you in a very
different manner from what most parents do. My
opinion has always been, that when that period arrives,
the parental authority ceases.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I hope</span> I shall always treat you with that affection
and easy confidence which may dispose you to look
on me as your friend. In that capacity alone I shall
think myself entitled to give you my opinion; in
the doing of which, I should think myself highly
criminal, if I did not to the utmost of my power endeavour
to divest myself of all personal vanity, and
all prejudices in favour of my particular taste. If
you did not chuse to follow my advice, I should not
on that account cease to love you as my children.—Though
my right to your obedience was expired, yet
I should think nothing could release me from the ties
of nature and humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>You</span> may perhaps imagine, that the reserved behaviour
which I recommend to you, and your appearing
seldom at public places, must cut off all opportunities
of your being acquainted with gentlemen. I am very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>far from intending this. I advise you to no reserve,
but what will render you more respected and beloved
by our sex. I do not think public places suited to
make people acquainted together. They can only be
distinguished there by their looks and external behaviour.
But it is in private companies alone where you
can expect easy and agreeable conversation, which I
should never wish you to decline. If you do not allow
gentlemen to become acquainted with you, you can never
expect to marry with attachment on either side.—Love
is very seldom produced at first sight; at least
it must have, in that case, a very unjustifiable foundation.
True love is founded on esteem, in a correspondence
of tastes and sentiments, and steals on the heart
imperceptibly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> is one advice I shall leave you, to which I
beg your particular attention: Before your affections
come to be in the least engaged to any man, examine
your tempers, your tastes, and your hearts, very severely,
and settle in your own minds, what are the requisites
to your happiness in a married state; and as it is
almost impossible that you should get every thing you
wish, come to a steady determination what you are to
consider as essential, and what may be sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you have hearts disposed by nature for love and
friendship, and possess those feelings which enable you
to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of these
attachments, consider well, for heaven’s sake, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>you value your future happiness, before you give them
any indulgence. If you have the misfortune (for a very
great misfortune it commonly is to your sex) to have
such a temper and such sentiments deeply rooted in
you, if you have spirit and resolution to resist the solicitations
of vanity, the persecution of friends (for you
will have lost the only friend that would never persecute
you) and can support the prospect of the many inconveniencies
attending the state of an old maid, which
I formerly pointed out, then you may indulge yourselves
in that kind of sentimental reading and conversation
which is most correspondent to your feelings.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>But</span> if you find, on a strict self-examination, that
marriage is absolutely essential to your happiness, keep
the secret inviolable in your own bosoms, for the reason
I formerly mentioned; but shun as you would do
the most fatal poison, all that species of reading and
conversation which warms the imagination, which engages
and softens the heart, and raises the taste above the
level of common life. If you do otherwise, consider
the terrible conflict of passions this may afterwards
raise in your breasts.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> this refinement once takes deep root in your minds,
and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar
and mercenary views, you may never be able to
eradicate it entirely, and then it will imbitter all your
married days. Instead of meeting with sense, delicacy,
tenderness, a lover, a friend, an equal companion, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a husband, you may be tired with insipidity and dullness;
shocked with indelicacy, or mortified by indifference.
You will find none to compassionate, or even
understand your sufferings; for your husbands may not
use you cruelly, and may give you as much money for
your clothes, personal expense, and domestic necessaries,
as is suitable to their fortunes. The world therefore
would look on you as unreasonable women, and that
did not deserve to be happy, if you were not so.—To
avoid these complicated evils, if you are determined
at all events to marry, I would advise you to make all
your reading and amusements of such a kind, as do not
affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the
way of wit or humour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> no view by these advices to lead your tastes;
I only want to persuade you of the necessity of knowing
your own minds, which, though seemingly very
easy, is what your sex seldom attain on many important
occasions in life, but particularly on this of which I am
speaking. There is not a quality I more anxiously
wish you to possess, than that collected decisive spirit
which rests on itself, which enables you to see where
your true happiness lies, and to pursue it with the most
determined resolution. In matters of business, follow
the advice of those who know them better than yourselves,
and in whose integrity you can confide; but in
matters of taste, that depend on your own feelings,
consult no one friend whatever, but consult your own
hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span><span class='sc'>If</span> a gentleman makes his addresses to you, or gives
you reason to believe he will do so, before you allow
your affections to be engaged, endeavour in the most
prudent and secret manner, to procure from your friends
every necessary piece of information concerning him;
such as his character for sense, his morals, his temper,
fortune and family; whether it is distinguished for
parts and worth, or for folly, knavery, and loathsome
hereditary diseases. When your friends inform you
of these, they have fulfilled their duty. If they go
further, they have not that deference for you which
a becoming dignity on your part would effectually
command.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Whatever</span> your views are in marrying, take every
possible precaution to prevent their being disappointed.
If fortune, and the pleasures it brings, are your
aim, it is not sufficient that the settlements of a jointure
and children’s provisions be ample, and properly
secured; it is necessary that you should enjoy the fortune
during your own life. The principal security you
can have for this will depend on your marrying a good-natured
generous man, who despises money, and who
will let you live where you can best enjoy that pleasure,
that pomp and parade of life for which you married
him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>From</span> what I have said, you will easily see that I
could never pretend to advise whom you should marry;
but I can with great confidence advise whom you
should not marry.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><span class='sc'>Avoid</span> a companion that may entail any hereditary
disease on your posterity, particularly (that most dreadful
of all human calamities) madness. It is the height
of imprudence to run into such a danger, and in my
opinion, highly criminal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Do</span> not marry a fool; he is the most intractable of
all animals; he is led by his passions and caprices,
and is incapable of hearing the voice of reason. It
may probably too hurt your vanity to have husbands
for whom you have reason to blush and tremble every
time they open their lips in company. But the worst
circumstance, that attends a fool, is his constant jealousy
of his wife being thought to govern him. This
renders it impossible to lead him, and he is continually
doing absurd and disagreeable things, for no other
reason but to shew he dares do them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A rake</span> is always a suspicious husband, because
he has only known the most worthless of your sex.
He likewise entails the worst diseases on his wife and
children, if he has the misfortune to have any.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you have a sense of religion yourselves, do not
think of husbands who have none. If they have tolerable
understandings, they will be glad that you have
religion, for their own sakes, and for the sake of their
families; but it will sink you in their esteem. If they
are weak men, they will be continually teazing and
shocking you about your principles.—If you have
children, you will suffer the most bitter distress, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>seeing all your endeavours to form their minds to virtue
and piety, all your endeavours to secure their present
and eternal happiness frustrated, and turned into
ridicule.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>As</span> I look on your choice of a husband to be of the
greatest consequence to your happiness, I hope you
will make it with the utmost circumspection. Do not
give way to a sudden sally of passion, and dignify it
with the name of love.—Genuine love is not founded
in caprice; it is founded in nature, on honourable
views, on virtue, on similarity of tastes and sympathy
of souls.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> you have these sentiments, you will never marry
any one, when you are not in that situation, in point
of fortune, which is necessary to the happiness of either
of you. What that competency may be, can only be
determined by your own tastes. It would be ungenerous
in you to take advantage of a lover’s attachment,
to plunge him into distress; and if he has any honour,
no personal gratification will ever tempt him to enter
into any connection which will render you unhappy.
If you have as much between you as to satisfy all your
reasonable demands, it is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I shall</span> conclude with endeavouring to remove
a difficulty which must naturally occur to any woman
of reflection on the subject of marriage. What is to
become of all these refinements of delicacy, that dignity
of manners, which checked all familiarities, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>suspended desire in respectful and awful admiration?
In answer to this, I shall only observe, that if motives
of interest or vanity have had any share in your resolutions
to marry, none of these chimerical notions will
give you any pain; nay they will very quickly appear
as ridiculous in your own eyes, as they probably always
did in the eyes of your husbands. They have
been sentiments which have floated in your imaginations,
but have never reached your hearts. But if
these sentiments have been truly genuine, and if you
have had the singular happy fate to attach those who
understand them, you have no reason to be afraid.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Marriage</span> indeed, will at once dispel the enchantment
raised by external beauty; but the virtues and
graces that first warmed the heart, that reserve and
delicacy which always left the lover something further
to wish, and often made him doubtful of your sensibility
or attachment, may and ought ever to remain. The
tumult of passion will necessarily subside; but it will
be succeeded by an endearment, that affects the heart
in a more equal, more sensible, and tender manner.—But
I must check myself, and not indulge in descriptions
that may mislead you, and that too sensibly awake
the remembrance of my happier days, which, perhaps,
it were better for me to forget forever.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>I have</span> thus given you my opinion on some of the
most important articles of your future life, chiefly calculated
for that period when you are just entering the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>I have endeavoured to avoid some peculiarities of opinion,
which, from their contradiction to the general
practice of the world, I might reasonably have suspected
were not so well founded. But in writing to
you, I am afraid my heart has been too full, and too
warmly interested, to allow me to keep this resolution.
This may have produced some embarrassment, and
some seeming contradictions. What I have written
has been the amusement of some solitary hours, and
has served to divert some melancholy reflections.—I
am conscious I undertook a task to which I was very
unequal; but I have discharged a part of my duty.—You
will at least be pleased with it, as the last mark
of your father’s love and attention.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
